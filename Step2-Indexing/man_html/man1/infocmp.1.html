<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">infocmp</span> can be used to compare a binary <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> entry with other terminfo entries, rewrite a <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> description to take advantage of the <span Class="bold">use=</span> terminfo field, or print out a <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> description from the binary file (<span Class="bold">term</span>) in a variety of formats. In all cases, the boolean fields will be printed first, followed by the numeric fields, followed by the string fields. <a name="Default"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Default Options</h2>
<p class="level0">If no options are specified and zero or one <span Class="emphasis">termnames</span> are specified, the <span Class="bold">-I</span> option will be assumed. If more than one <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> is specified, the <span Class="bold">-d</span> option will be assumed. <a name="Comparison"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Comparison Options [-d] [-c] [-n]</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">infocmp</span> compares the <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> description of the first terminal <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> with each of the descriptions given by the entries for the other terminal's <span Class="emphasis">termnames</span>. If a capability is defined for only one of the terminals, the value returned will depend on the type of the capability: <span Class="bold">F</span> for boolean variables, <span Class="bold">-1</span> for integer variables, and <span Class="bold">NULL</span> for string variables. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-d</span> option produces a list of each capability that is different between two entries. This option is useful to show the difference between two entries, created by different people, for the same or similar terminals. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-c</span> option produces a list of each capability that is common between two or more entries. Capabilities that are not set are ignored. This option can be used as a quick check to see if the <span Class="bold">-u</span> option is worth using. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-n</span> option produces a list of each capability that is in none of the given entries. If no <span Class="emphasis">termnames</span> are given, the environment variable <span Class="bold">TERM</span> will be used for both of the <span Class="emphasis">termnames</span>. This can be used as a quick check to see if anything was left out of a description. <a name="Source"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Source Listing Options [-I] [-L] [-C] [-r]</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-I</span>, <span Class="bold">-L</span>, and <span Class="bold">-C</span> options will produce a source listing for each terminal named. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">center tab(/) ; l l . <span Class="bold">-I</span>/use the <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> names <span Class="bold">-L</span>/use the long C variable name listed in &lt;<span Class="bold">term.h</span>&gt; <span Class="bold">-C</span>/use the <span Class="bold">termcap</span> names <span Class="bold">-r</span>/when using <span Class="bold">-C</span>, put out all capabilities in <span Class="bold">termcap</span> form <span Class="bold">-K</span>/modifies the <span Class="bold">-C</span> option, improving BSD-compatibility. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If no <span Class="emphasis">termnames</span> are given, the environment variable <span Class="bold">TERM</span> will be used for the terminal name. 
<p class="level0">The source produced by the <span Class="bold">-C</span> option may be used directly as a <span Class="bold">termcap</span> entry, but not all parameterized strings can be changed to the <span Class="bold">termcap</span> format. <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> will attempt to convert most of the parameterized information, and anything not converted will be plainly marked in the output and commented out. These should be edited by hand. 
<p class="level0">For best results when converting to <span Class="bold">termcap</span> format, you should use both <span Class="bold">-C</span> and <span Class="bold">-r</span>. Normally a termcap description is limited to 1023 bytes. infocmp trims away less essential parts to make it fit. If you are converting to one of the (rare) termcap implementations which accept an unlimited size of termcap, you may want to add the <span Class="bold">-T</span> option. More often however, you must help the termcap implementation, and trim excess whitespace (use the <span Class="bold">-0</span> option for that). 
<p class="level0">All padding information for strings will be collected together and placed at the beginning of the string where <span Class="bold">termcap</span> expects it. Mandatory padding (padding information with a trailing '/') will become optional. 
<p class="level0">All <span Class="bold">termcap</span> variables no longer supported by <span Class="bold">terminfo</span>, but which are derivable from other <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> variables, will be output. Not all <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> capabilities will be translated; only those variables which were part of <span Class="bold">termcap</span> will normally be output. Specifying the <span Class="bold">-r</span> option will take off this restriction, allowing all capabilities to be output in <span Class="emphasis">termcap</span> form. Normally you would use both the <span Class="bold">-C</span> and <span Class="bold">-r</span> options. The actual format used incorporates some improvements for escaped characters from terminfo format. For a stricter BSD-compatible translation, use the <span Class="bold">-K</span> option rather than <span Class="bold">-C</span>. 
<p class="level0">Note that because padding is collected to the beginning of the capability, not all capabilities are output. Mandatory padding is not supported. Because <span Class="bold">termcap</span> strings are not as flexible, it is not always possible to convert a <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> string capability into an equivalent <span Class="bold">termcap</span> format. A subsequent conversion of the <span Class="bold">termcap</span> file back into <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> format will not necessarily reproduce the original <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> source. 
<p class="level0">Some common <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> parameter sequences, their <span Class="bold">termcap</span> equivalents, and some terminal types which commonly have such sequences, are: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">center tab(/) ; l c l l l l. <span Class="bold">terminfo/termcap</span>/Representative Terminals = <span Class="bold">%p1%c/%.</span>/adm <span Class="bold">%p1%d/%d</span>/hp, ANSI standard, vt100 <span Class="bold">%p1%'x'%+%c/%+x</span>/concept <span Class="bold">%i/%i</span>q/ANSI standard, vt100 <span Class="bold">%p1%?%'x'%&gt;%t%p1%'y'%+%;/%&gt;xy</span>/concept <span Class="bold">%p2</span> is printed before <span Class="bold">%p1/%r</span>/hp 
<p class="level0"><a name="Use"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Use= Option [-u]</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-u</span> option produces a <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> source description of the first terminal <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> which is relative to the sum of the descriptions given by the entries for the other terminals <span Class="emphasis">termnames</span>. It does this by analyzing the differences between the first <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> and the other <span Class="emphasis">termnames</span> and producing a description with <span Class="bold">use=</span> fields for the other terminals. In this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo entries into a terminal's description. Or, if two similar terminals exist, but were coded at different times or by different people so that each description is a full description, using <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> will show what can be done to change one description to be relative to the other. 
<p class="level0">A capability will get printed with an at-sign (@) if it no longer exists in the first <span Class="emphasis">termname</span>, but one of the other <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> entries contains a value for it. A capability's value gets printed if the value in the first <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> is not found in any of the other <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> entries, or if the first of the other <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> entries that has this capability gives a different value for the capability than that in the first <span Class="emphasis">termname</span>. 
<p class="level0">The order of the other <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> entries is significant. Since the terminfo compiler <span Class="bold">tic</span> does a left-to-right scan of the capabilities, specifying two <span Class="bold">use=</span> entries that contain differing entries for the same capabilities will produce different results depending on the order that the entries are given in. <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> will flag any such inconsistencies between the other <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> entries as they are found. 
<p class="level0">Alternatively, specifying a capability <span Class="emphasis">after</span> a <span Class="bold">use=</span> entry that contains that capability will cause the second specification to be ignored. Using <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> to recreate a description can be a useful check to make sure that everything was specified correctly in the original source description. 
<p class="level0">Another error that does not cause incorrect compiled files, but will slow down the compilation time, is specifying extra <span Class="bold">use=</span> fields that are superfluous. <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> will flag any other <span Class="emphasis">termname use=</span> fields that were not needed. <a name="Changing"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Changing Databases [-A \fIdirectory\fR] [-B \fIdirectory\fR]</h2>
<p class="level0">Like other <span Class="bold">ncurses</span> utilities, infocmp looks for the terminal descriptions in several places. You can use the <span Class="bold">TERMINFO</span> and <span Class="bold">TERMINFO_DIRS</span> environment variables to override the compiled-in default list of places to search (see <span Class="bold">curses</span>(3X) for details). 
<p class="level0">You can also use the options <span Class="bold">-A</span> and <span Class="bold">-B</span> to override the list of places to search when comparing terminal descriptions: 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-A</span> option sets the location for the first <span Class="emphasis">termname</span> 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-B</span> option sets the location for the other <span Class="emphasis">termnames</span>. 
<p class="level0">Using these options, it is possible to compare descriptions for a terminal with the same name located in two different databases. For instance, you can use this feature for comparing descriptions for the same terminal created by different people. <a name="Other"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Other Options</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-0</span> causes the fields to be printed on one line, without wrapping. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-1</span> causes the fields to be printed out one to a line. Otherwise, the fields will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60 characters. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-a</span> tells <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> to retain commented-out capabilities rather than discarding them. Capabilities are commented by prefixing them with a period. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-D</span> tells <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> to print the database locations that it knows about, and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-E</span> Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as tables, needed in the C initializer for a TERMTYPE structure (the terminal capability structure in the <span Class="bold">&lt;term.h&gt;</span>). This option is useful for preparing versions of the curses library hardwired for a given terminal type. The tables are all declared static, and are named according to the type and the name of the corresponding terminal entry. 
<p class="level0">Before ncurses 5.0, the split between the <span Class="bold">-e</span> and <span Class="bold">-E</span> options was not needed; but support for extended names required making the arrays of terminal capabilities separate from the TERMTYPE structure. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-e</span> Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as a C initializer for a TERMTYPE structure (the terminal capability structure in the <span Class="bold">&lt;term.h&gt;</span>). This option is useful for preparing versions of the curses library hardwired for a given terminal type. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-F</span> compare terminfo files. This assumes that two following arguments are filenames. The files are searched for pairwise matches between entries, with two entries considered to match if any of their names do. The report printed to standard output lists entries with no matches in the other file, and entries with more than one match. For entries with exactly one match it includes a difference report. Normally, to reduce the volume of the report, use references are not resolved before looking for differences, but resolution can be forced by also specifying <span Class="bold">-r</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f</span> Display complex terminfo strings which contain if/then/else/endif expressions indented for readability. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-G</span> Display constant literals in decimal form rather than their character equivalents. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-g</span> Display constant character literals in quoted form rather than their decimal equivalents. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-i</span> Analyze the initialization (<span Class="bold">is1</span>, <span Class="bold">is2</span>, <span Class="bold">is3</span>), and reset (<span Class="bold">rs1</span>, <span Class="bold">rs2</span>, <span Class="bold">rs3</span>), strings in the entry. For each string, the code tries to analyze it into actions in terms of the other capabilities in the entry, certain X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 capabilities, and certain DEC VT-series private modes (the set of recognized special sequences has been selected for completeness over the existing terminfo database). Each report line consists of the capability name, followed by a colon and space, followed by a printable expansion of the capability string with sections matching recognized actions translated into {}-bracketed descriptions. Here is a list of the DEC/ANSI special sequences recognized: i. 
<p class="level0">center tab(/) ; l l l l. Action/Meaning = RIS/full reset SC/save cursor RC/restore cursor LL/home-down RSR/reset scroll region = DECSTR/soft reset (VT320) S7C1T/7-bit controls (VT220) = ISO DEC G0/enable DEC graphics for G0 ISO UK G0/enable UK chars for G0 ISO US G0/enable US chars for G0 ISO DEC G1/enable DEC graphics for G1 ISO UK G1/enable UK chars for G1 ISO US G1/enable US chars for G1 = DECPAM/application keypad mode DECPNM/normal keypad mode DECANSI/enter ANSI mode = ECMA[+-]AM/keyboard action mode ECMA[+-]IRM/insert replace mode ECMA[+-]SRM/send receive mode ECMA[+-]LNM/linefeed mode = DEC[+-]CKM/application cursor keys DEC[+-]ANM/set VT52 mode DEC[+-]COLM/132-column mode DEC[+-]SCLM/smooth scroll DEC[+-]SCNM/reverse video mode DEC[+-]OM/origin mode DEC[+-]AWM/wraparound mode DEC[+-]ARM/auto-repeat mode

<p class="level0">It also recognizes a SGR action corresponding to ANSI/ISO 6429/ECMA Set Graphics Rendition, with the values NORMAL, BOLD, UNDERLINE, BLINK, and REVERSE. All but NORMAL may be prefixed with `+' (turn on) or `-' (turn off). 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">An SGR0 designates an empty highlight sequence (equivalent to {SGR:NORMAL}). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-l</span> Set output format to terminfo. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-p</span> Ignore padding specifications when comparing strings. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-q</span> Make the comparison listing shorter by omitting subheadings, and using "-" for absent capabilities, "@" for canceled rather than "NULL". 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-R</span><span Class="emphasis">subset</span> Restrict output to a given subset. This option is for use with archaic versions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or HP/UX that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and variants such as AIX that have their own extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI. Available terminfo subsets are "SVr1", "Ultrix", "HP", and "AIX"; see <span Class="bold">terminfo</span>(*n) for details. You can also choose the subset "BSD" which selects only capabilities with termcap equivalents recognized by 4.4BSD. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-s </span><span Class="emphasis">[d|i|l|c]</span> The <span Class="bold">-s</span> option sorts the fields within each type according to the argument below: <br>
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">d</span> leave fields in the order that they are stored in the <span Class="emphasis">terminfo</span> database. 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">i</span> sort by <span Class="emphasis">terminfo</span> name. 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">l</span> sort by the long C variable name. 
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">c</span> sort by the <span Class="emphasis">termcap</span> name. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If the <span Class="bold">-s</span> option is not given, the fields printed out will be sorted alphabetically by the <span Class="bold">terminfo</span> name within each type, except in the case of the <span Class="bold">-C</span> or the <span Class="bold">-L</span> options, which cause the sorting to be done by the <span Class="bold">termcap</span> name or the long C variable name, respectively. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-T</span> eliminates size-restrictions on the generated text. This is mainly useful for testing and analysis, since the compiled descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-t</span> tells <span Class="bold">tic</span> to discard commented-out capabilities. Normally when translating from terminfo to termcap, untranslatable capabilities are commented-out. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-U</span> tells <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> to not post-process the data after parsing the source file. This feature helps when comparing the actual contents of two source files, since it excludes the inferences that <span Class="bold">infocmp</span> makes to fill in missing data. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-V</span> reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-v</span> <span Class="emphasis">n</span> prints out tracing information on standard error as the program runs. Higher values of n induce greater verbosity.
