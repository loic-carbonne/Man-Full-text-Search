<p class="level0">This manual page documents briefly the <span Class="bold">gmrun</span> command. This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">gmrun</span> is a program that allows a user to use a CLI-like interface to launch applications from within the X11 windowing environment. It is based on the GTK+ toolkit. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">If gmrun is invoked with a command-line parameter, that will be the initial content of the dialog box. 
<p class="level0">gmrun can be customized using a configuration file, ~/.gmrunrc . The system-wide configuration file is /etc/gmrunrc . 
<p class="level0">The format of the configuration file is simple; "variable = value". To refer to a variable as opposed to setting it, enclose the variable in ${}. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Example:</span> variable1 = foobar <br>newvariable = ${variable1} foobaz 
<p class="level0">Were this placed within the configuration file, the gmrun variable "newvariable" would contain the text "foobar foobaz". Some variables that are understood by gmrun, by default. These are: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Terminal</span> The command to run when Ctrl+Enter is pressed with no command entered; used to start a new terminal. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TermExec</span> The command to run when Ctrl+Enter is pressed with a command entered. The entered command is supplied as an argument to TermExec. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Width</span> Initial width of gmrun window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Top, Left</span> Initial placement of gmrun window - specify both Top and Left variables such that the gmrun window is placed at pixel (Top,Left) of your desktop. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">History</span> Number of entered commands which should be kept in gmrun's history(~/.gmrun_history). Using the Up and Down arrow keys within the gmrun window will cycle through the history. You can search backwards through the history with Ctrl+R or by writing <span Class="bold">!</span> (exclamation mark), and forward with Ctrl+S. To cancel a search, hit Ctrl+G or the <span Class="emphasis">ESC</span> key. Otherwise, after you have found the history item you wish to run, hit Enter. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ShowLast</span> Whether to show the last command as initial text, or an empty textarea (1 or 0). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Selected</span> Whether the initial text should be selected or not (1 or 0). <a name="URL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">URL HANDLING</h2>
<p class="level0">As opposed to entering a command, gmrun supports the entering of URLs. The included configuration file(/etc/gmrunrc) gives some examples. To set up your own url, create a variable in /etc/gmrunrc or ~/.gmrunrc with the format of "URL_protocol". For instance, URL_http. Here is an example: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">URL_http = /usr/bin/mozilla %u</span> Using this, entering "<a href="http://www.slashdot.org">http://www.slashdot.org</a>" will run '/usr/bin/mozilla <a href="http://slashdot.org'.">http://slashdot.org'.</a> 
<p class="level0">gmrun may also strip the protocol and colon away from the entered URL before passing it to the defined program. For example: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">URL_mailto = mutt %s</span> Using this, entering "mailto:david@eelf.ddts.net" will run the command 'mutt david@eelf.ddts.net' 
<p class="level0">The included configuration files has a few examples which you can work with. You should also note that the protocol part of URL_protocol can be *anything*. You can set up "URL_foobarbazcustom", and so long as you enter in "foobarbazcustom:&lt;whatever&gt;", it will use the given program. Have fun :) <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
