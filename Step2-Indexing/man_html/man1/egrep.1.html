Specifying <span Class="bold">-U</span> overrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read and passed to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line, this will cause some regular expressions to fail.

<p class="level0"><a name="REGULAR"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings. Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">grep</span> understands three different versions of regular expression syntax: *(lqbasic*(rq (BRE), *(lqextended*(rq (ERE) and *(lqperl*(rq (PRCE). In 
<p class="level0">there is no difference in available functionality between basic and extended syntaxes. In other implementations, basic regular expressions are less powerful. The following description applies to extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards. Perl regular expressions give additional functionality, and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and pcrepattern(3), but only work if pcre is available in the system. 
<p class="level0">The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character. Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves. Any meta-character with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash. 
<p class="level0">The period <a class="bold" href="#">.\&</a> matches any single character. <a name="Character"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Character Classes and Bracket Expressions</h2>
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">bracket expression</span> is a list of characters enclosed by <a class="bold" href="#">[</a> and <a class="manpage" href="#">] .</a>It matches any single character in that list; if the first character of the list is the caret <a class="bold" href="#">^</a> then it matches any character <span Class="emphasis">not</span> in the list. For example, the regular expression <span Class="bold">[0123456789]</span> matches any single digit. 
<p class="level0">Within a bracket expression, a <span Class="emphasis">range expression</span> consists of two characters separated by a hyphen. It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set. For example, in the default C locale, <span Class="bold">[a-d]</span> is equivalent to <span Class="manpage">[abcd] .</span>Many locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales <span Class="bold">[a-d]</span> is typically not equivalent to <span Class="manpage">[abcd] ;</span>it might be equivalent to <span Class="manpage">[aBbCcDd]</span>for example. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the <span Class="bold">LC_ALL</span> environment variable to the value <span Class="manpage">C .</span>
<p class="level0">Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within bracket expressions, as follows. Their names are self explanatory, and they are <span Class="manpage">[:alnum:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:alpha:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:cntrl:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:digit:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:graph:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:lower:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:print:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:punct:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:space:]</span>, <span Class="manpage">[:upper:]</span>and <span Class="manpage">[:xdigit:].</span>For example, <span Class="bold">[[:alnum:]]</span> means the character class of numbers and letters in the current locale. In the C locale and s-1ASCIIs0 character set encoding, this is the same as <span Class="manpage">[0-9A-Za-z] .</span>(Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket expression.) Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions. To include a literal <a class="bold" href="#">]</a> place it first in the list. Similarly, to include a literal <a class="bold" href="#">^</a> place it anywhere but first. Finally, to include a literal <span Class="bold">-</span> place it last. <a name="Anchoring"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Anchoring</h2>
<p class="level0">The caret <a class="bold" href="#">^</a> and the dollar sign <a class="bold" href="#">$</a> are meta-characters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line. <a name="The"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">The Backslash Character and Special Expressions</h2>
<p class="level0">The symbols <span Class="bold">\e&lt;</span> and <span Class="bold">\e&gt;</span> respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word. The symbol <span Class="bold">\eb</span> matches the empty string at the edge of a word, and <span Class="bold">\eB</span> matches the empty string provided it's <span Class="emphasis">not</span> at the edge of a word. The symbol <span Class="bold">\ew</span> is a synonym for <span Class="bold">[_[:alnum:]]</span> and <span Class="bold">\eW</span> is a synonym for <span Class="manpage">[^_[:alnum:]] .</span><a name="Repetition"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Repetition</h2>
<p class="level0">A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">?</a> The preceding item is optional and matched at most once. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">*</a> The preceding item will be matched zero or more times. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">+</a> The preceding item will be matched one or more times. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">{ n }</a> The preceding item is matched exactly <span Class="emphasis">n</span> times. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">{ n ,}</a> The preceding item is matched <span Class="emphasis">n</span> or more times. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">{, m }</a> The preceding item is matched at most <span Class="emphasis">m</span> times. This is a s-1GNUs0 extension. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">{ n , m }</a> The preceding item is matched at least <span Class="emphasis">n</span> times, but not more than <span Class="emphasis">m</span> times. 
<p class="level0"><a name="Concatenation"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Concatenation</h2>
<p class="level0">Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings that respectively match the concatenated expressions. <a name="Alternation"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Alternation</h2>
<p class="level0">Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator <a class="manpage" href="#">| ;</a>the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either alternate expression. <a name="Precedence"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Precedence</h2>
<p class="level0">Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over alternation.

<p class="level0">Traditional <span Class="bold">egrep</span> did not support the <a class="bold" href="#">{</a> meta-character, and some <span Class="bold">egrep</span> implementations support <span Class="bold">\e{</span> instead, so portable scripts should avoid <a class="bold" href="#">{</a> in <span Class="bold">grep\ -E</span> patterns and should use <a class="bold" href="#">[{]</a> to match a literal <a class="manpage" href="#">{ .</a>
<p class="level0">s-1GNUs0 <span Class="bold">grep\ -E</span> attempts to support traditional usage by assuming that <a class="bold" href="#">{</a> is not special if it would be the start of an invalid interval specification. For example, the command <span Class="bold">grep\ -E\ \(aq{1\(aq</span> searches for the two-character string <span Class="bold">{1</span> instead of reporting a syntax error in the regular expression. s-1POSIXs0 allows this behavior as an extension, but portable scripts should avoid it. 
<p class="level0"><a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<p class="level0">The behavior of <span Class="bold">grep</span> is affected by the following environment variables. 
<p class="level0">The locale for category <span Class="bold">LC_ foo</span> is specified by examining the three environment variables <span Class="manpage">LC_ALL</span>, <span Class="manpage">LC_\fIfoo\fP</span>, <span Class="manpage">LANG</span>in that order. The first of these variables that is set specifies the locale. For example, if <span Class="bold">LC_ALL</span> is not set, but <span Class="bold">LC_MESSAGES</span> is set to <span Class="manpage">pt_BR</span>then the Brazilian Portuguese locale is used for the <span Class="bold">LC_MESSAGES</span> category. The C locale is used if none of these environment variables are set, if the locale catalog is not installed, or if <span Class="bold">grep</span> was not compiled with national language support (s-1NLSs0). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GREP_OPTIONS</span> This variable specifies default options to be placed in front of any explicit options. For example, if <span Class="bold">GREP_OPTIONS</span> is <span Class="manpage">\(aq-\^-binary-files=without-match -\^-directories=skip\(aq</span><span Class="bold">grep</span> behaves as if the two options <span Class="bold">-\^-binary-files=without-match</span> and <span Class="bold">-\^-directories=skip</span> had been specified before any explicit options. Option specifications are separated by whitespace. A backslash escapes the next character, so it can be used to specify an option containing whitespace or a backslash. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GREP_COLOR</span> This variable specifies the color used to highlight matched (non-empty) text. It is deprecated in favor of <span Class="manpage">GREP_COLORS</span>but still supported. The <span Class="manpage">mt</span>, <span Class="manpage">ms</span>and <span Class="bold">mc</span> capabilities of <span Class="bold">GREP_COLORS</span> have priority over it. It can only specify the color used to highlight the matching non-empty text in any matching line (a selected line when the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option is omitted, or a context line when <span Class="bold">-v</span> is specified). The default is <span Class="manpage">01;31</span>which means a bold red foreground text on the terminal's default background. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GREP_COLORS</span> Specifies the colors and other attributes used to highlight various parts of the output. Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities that defaults to <span Class="bold">ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36</span> with the <span Class="bold">rv</span> and <span Class="bold">ne</span> boolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false). Supported capabilities are as follows. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">sl=</span> SGR substring for whole selected lines (i.e., matching lines when the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option is omitted, or non-matching lines when <span Class="bold">-v</span> is specified). If however the boolean <span Class="bold">rv</span> capability and the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option are both specified, it applies to context matching lines instead. The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">cx=</span> SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-matching lines when the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option is omitted, or matching lines when <span Class="bold">-v</span> is specified). If however the boolean <span Class="bold">rv</span> capability and the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option are both specified, it applies to selected non-matching lines instead. The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">rv</span> Boolean value that reverses (swaps) the meanings of the <span Class="bold">sl=</span> and <span Class="bold">cx=</span> capabilities when the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option is specified. The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">mt=01;31</span> SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any matching line (i.e., a selected line when the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option is omitted, or a context line when <span Class="bold">-v</span> is specified). Setting this is equivalent to setting both <span Class="bold">ms=</span> and <span Class="bold">mc=</span> at once to the same value. The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">ms=01;31</span> SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a selected line. (This is only used when the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option is omitted.) The effect of the <span Class="bold">sl=</span> (or <span Class="bold">cx=</span> if <span Class="manpage">rv )</span>capability remains active when this kicks in. The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">mc=01;31</span> SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a context line. (This is only used when the <span Class="bold">-v</span> command-line option is specified.) The effect of the <span Class="bold">cx=</span> (or <span Class="bold">sl=</span> if <span Class="manpage">rv )</span>capability remains active when this kicks in. The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">fn=35</span> SGR substring for file names prefixing any content line. The default is a magenta text foreground over the terminal's default background. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">ln=32</span> SGR substring for line numbers prefixing any content line. The default is a green text foreground over the terminal's default background. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">bn=32</span> SGR substring for byte offsets prefixing any content line. The default is a green text foreground over the terminal's default background. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">se=36</span> SGR substring for separators that are inserted between selected line fields 
<p class="level1">between context line fields, 
<p class="level1">and between groups of adjacent lines when nonzero context is specified 
<p class="level1">The default is a cyan text foreground over the terminal's default background. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">ne</span> Boolean value that prevents clearing to the end of line using Erase in Line (EL) to Right 
<p class="level1">each time a colorized item ends. This is needed on terminals on which EL is not supported. It is otherwise useful on terminals for which the <span Class="bold">back_color_erase</span> 
<p class="level1">boolean terminfo capability does not apply, when the chosen highlight colors do not affect the background, or when EL is too slow or causes too much flicker. The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted). 
<p class="level1">Note that boolean capabilities have no <a class="manpage" href="#">= ...</a>part. They are omitted (i.e., false) by default and become true when specified. 
<p class="level1">See the Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the documentation of the text terminal that is used for permitted values and their meaning as character attributes. These substring values are integers in decimal representation and can be concatenated with semicolons. <span Class="bold">grep</span> takes care of assembling the result into a complete SGR sequence 
<p class="level1">Common values to concatenate include <span Class="bold">1</span> for bold, <span Class="bold">4</span> for underline, <span Class="bold">5</span> for blink, <span Class="bold">7</span> for inverse, <span Class="bold">39</span> for default foreground color, <span Class="bold">30</span> to <span Class="bold">37</span> for foreground colors, <span Class="bold">90</span> to <span Class="bold">97</span> for 16-color mode foreground colors, <span Class="bold">38;5;0</span> to <span Class="bold">38;5;255</span> for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors, <span Class="bold">49</span> for default background color, <span Class="bold">40</span> to <span Class="bold">47</span> for background colors, <span Class="bold">100</span> to <span Class="bold">107</span> for 16-color mode background colors, and <span Class="bold">48;5;0</span> to <span Class="bold">48;5;255</span> for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LC_ALL</span>, <span Class="bold">LC_COLLATE</span>, <span Class="bold">LANG</span> These variables specify the locale for the <span Class="bold">LC_COLLATE</span> category, which determines the collating sequence used to interpret range expressions like <span Class="manpage">[a-z] .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LC_ALL</span>, <span Class="bold">LC_CTYPE</span>, <span Class="bold">LANG</span> These variables specify the locale for the <span Class="bold">LC_CTYPE</span> category, which determines the type of characters, e.g., which characters are whitespace. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LC_ALL</span>, <span Class="bold">LC_MESSAGES</span>, <span Class="bold">LANG</span> These variables specify the locale for the <span Class="bold">LC_MESSAGES</span> category, which determines the language that <span Class="bold">grep</span> uses for messages. The default C locale uses American English messages. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">POSIXLY_CORRECT</span> If set, <span Class="bold">grep</span> behaves as s-1POSIXs0 requires; otherwise, <span Class="bold">grep</span> behaves more like other s-1GNUs0 programs. s-1POSIXs0 requires that options that follow file names must be treated as file names; by default, such options are permuted to the front of the operand list and are treated as options. Also, s-1POSIXs0 requires that unrecognized options be diagnosed as *(lqillegal*(rq, but since they are not really against the law the default is to diagnose them as *(lqinvalid*(rq. <span Class="bold">POSIXLY_CORRECT</span> also disables <a class="bold" href="#">_</a><span Class="emphasis">N</span><span Class="bold">_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_</span>, described below. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">_</a><span Class="emphasis">N</span><span Class="bold">_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_</span> (Here <span Class="emphasis">N</span> is <span Class="manpage">grep 's</span>numeric process ID.)  If the <span Class="emphasis">i th</span> character of this environment variable's value is <span Class="manpage">1</span>do not consider the <span Class="emphasis">i th</span> operand of <span Class="bold">grep</span> to be an option, even if it appears to be one. A shell can put this variable in the environment for each command it runs, specifying which operands are the results of file name wildcard expansion and therefore should not be treated as options. This behavior is available only with the s-1GNUs0 C library, and only when <span Class="bold">POSIXLY_CORRECT</span> is not set. 
<p class="level0"><a name="EXIT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EXIT STATUS</h2>
<p class="level0">The exit status is 0 if selected lines are found, and 1 if not found.           If an error occurred the exit status is 2.  (Note: POSIX error  handling code should check for '2' or greater.)
