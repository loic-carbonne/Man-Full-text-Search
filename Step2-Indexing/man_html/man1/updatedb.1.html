<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">updatedb [options]</span> <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">This manual page documents the GNU version of <span Class="manpage">updatedb</span>which updates file name databases used by GNU <span Class="manpage">locate .</span>The file name databases contain lists of files that were in particular directory trees when the databases were last updated. The file name of the default database is determined when <span Class="bold">locate</span> and <span Class="bold">updatedb</span> are configured and installed.  The frequency with which the databases are updated and the directories for which they contain entries depend on how often <span Class="bold">updatedb</span> is run, and with which arguments. 
<p class="level0">In networked environments, it often makes sense to build a database at the root of each filesystem, containing the entries for that filesystem. <span Class="bold">updatedb</span> is then run for each filesystem on the fileserver where that filesystem is on a local disk, to prevent thrashing the network. Users can select which databases <span Class="bold">locate</span> searches using an environment variable or command line option; see <span Class="bold">locate</span>(1). Databases can not be concatenated together. 
<p class="level0">The file name database format changed starting with GNU <span Class="bold">find</span> and <span Class="bold">locate</span> version 4.0 to allow machines with different byte orderings to share the databases.  The new GNU <span Class="bold">locate</span> can read both the old and new database formats. However, old versions of <span Class="bold">locate</span> and <span Class="bold">find</span> produce incorrect results if given a new-format database. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--findoptions='-option1 -option2...'</span> Global options to pass on to <span Class="bold">find</span>. The environment variable <span Class="bold">FINDOPTIONS</span> also sets this value. Default is none. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--localpaths='path1 path2...'</span> Non-network directories to put in the database. Default is /. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--netpaths='path1 path2...'</span> Network (NFS, AFS, RFS, etc.) directories to put in the database. The environment variable <span Class="bold">NETPATHS</span> also sets this value. Default is none. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--prunepaths='path1 path2...'</span> Directories to not put in the database, which would otherwise be. Remove any trailing slashes from the path names, otherwise  <span Class="bold">updatedb</span> won&acute;t recognise the paths you want to omit (because it uses them as regular expression patterns). The environment variable <span Class="bold">PRUNEPATHS</span> also sets this value. Default is /tmp /usr/tmp /var/tmp /afs. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--prunefs='path...'</span> File systems to not put in the database, which would otherwise be. Note that files are pruned when a file system is reached; any file system mounted under an undesired file system will be ignored. The environment variable <span Class="bold">PRUNEFS</span> also sets this value. Default is <span Class="emphasis">nfs NFS proc</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--output=dbfile</span> The database file to build. Default is system-dependent.  In Debian GNU/Linux, the default is /var/cache/locate/locatedb. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--localuser=user</span> The user to search non-network directories as, using <span Class="bold">su</span>(1). Default is to search the non-network directories as the current user. You can also use the environment variable <span Class="bold">LOCALUSER</span> to set this user. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--netuser=user</span> The user to search network directories as, using <span Class="bold">su</span>(1). Default is <span Class="bold">daemon</span>. You can also use the environment variable <span Class="bold">NETUSER</span> to set this user. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--old-format</span> Create the database in the old format.  This is a synonym for  <span Class="manpage">--dbformat=old .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--dbformat=F</span> Create the database in format F.  The default format is called LOCATE02. F can be  <span Class="bold">old</span> to select the old database format (this is the same as specifying <span Class="manpage">--old-format ).</span>Alternatively the  <span Class="bold">slocate</span> format is also supported.  When the  <span Class="bold">slocate </span> format is in use, the database produced is marked as having security level 1.  If you want to build a system-wide <span Class="bold">slocate</span> database, you may want to run  <span Class="bold">updatedb</span> as root. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--version</span> Print the version number of <span Class="bold">updatedb</span> and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--help</span> Print a summary of the options to <span Class="bold">updatedb</span> and exit. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The  <span Class="bold">updatedb</span> program correctly handles filenames containing newlines, but only if the system's sort command has a working <span Class="emphasis">-z</span> option.  If you suspect that  <span Class="bold">locate</span> may need to return filenames containing newlines, consider using its <span Class="emphasis">--null </span> option.
