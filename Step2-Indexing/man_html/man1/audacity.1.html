<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Audacity</span> is a graphical audio editor.  This man page does not describe all of the features of Audacity or how to use it; for this, see the html documentation that came with the program, which should be accessible from the Help menu.  This man page describes the Unix-specific features, including special files and environment variables. 
<p class="level0">Audacity currently uses <span Class="bold">libsndfile</span> to open many uncompressed audio formats such as WAV, AIFF, and AU, and it can also be linked to <span Class="bold">libmad,</span> <span Class="bold">libvorbis,</span> and <span Class="bold">libflac,</span> to provide support for opening MP2/3, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC files, respectively. <span Class="bold">LAME, libvorbis, libflac</span> and <span Class="bold">libtwolame</span> provide facilities to export files to all these formats as well. 
<p class="level0">Audacity is primarily an interactive, graphical editor, not a batch-processing tool. Whilst there is a basic batch processing tool it is experimental and  incomplete. If you need to batch-process audio or do simple edits from the command line, using  <span Class="bold">sox</span> or <span Class="bold">ecasound</span> driven by a bash script will be much more powerful than audacity.

<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">~/.audacity-data/audacity.cfg</span> 
<p class="level1">Per user configuration file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">/var/tmp/audacity-&lt;user&gt;/</span> 
<p class="level1">Default location of Audacity's temp directory, where &lt;user&gt; is your username.  If this location is not suitable (not enough space in /var/tmp, for example), you should change the temp directory in the Preferences and restart Audacity.  Audacity is a disk-based editor, so the temp directory is very important: it should always be on a fast (local) disk with lots of free space. 
<p class="level1">Note that older versions of Audacity put the temp directory inside of the user's home directory.  This is undesirable on many systems, and using some directory in /tmp is recommended. 
<p class="level1">On many modern Linux systems all files in /tmp/ will be deleted  each time the system boots up, which makes recovering a recording that was going on when the system crashed much harder. This is why the default is to use a directory in /var/tmp/ which will not normally be deleted by the system. Open the Preferences to check. 
<p class="level0"><a name="SEARCH"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEARCH PATH</h2>
<p class="level0">When looking for plug-ins, help files, localization files, or other configuration files, Audacity searches the following locations, in this order: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">AUDACITY_PATH</span> 
<p class="level1">Any directories in the  <span Class="emphasis">AUDACITY_PATH </span> environment variable will be searched before anywhere else. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">.</span> 
<p class="level1">The current working directory when Audacity is started. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">~/.audacity-data/Plug-Ins</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/audacity</span> 
<p class="level1">The system-wide Audacity directory, where &lt;prefix&gt; is usually /usr or /usr/local, depending on where the program was installed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/doc/audacity</span> 
<p class="level1">The system-wide Audacity documentation directory, where &lt;prefix&gt; is usually /usr or /usr/local, depending on where the program was installed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">For localization files in particular (i.e. translations of Audacity into other languages), Audacity also searches <span Class="emphasis">&lt;prefix&gt;/share/locale</span> 
<p class="level0"><a name="PLUG-INS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PLUG-INS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Audacity supports two types of plug-ins on Unix: LADSPA and Nyquist plug-ins.  These are generally placed in a directory called  <span Class="emphasis">plug-ins </span> somewhere on the search path (see above). 
<p class="level0">LADSPA plug-ins can either be in the plug-ins directory, or alternatively in a  <span Class="emphasis">ladspa </span> directory on the search path if you choose to create one.  Audacity will also search the directories in the  <span Class="emphasis">LADSPA_PATH </span> environment variable for additional LADSPA plug-ins. 
<p class="level0">Nyquist plug-ins can either be in the plug-ins directory, or alternatively in a  <span Class="emphasis">nyquist</span> directory on the search path if you choose to create one.
