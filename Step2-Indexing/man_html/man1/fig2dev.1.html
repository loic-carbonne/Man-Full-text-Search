<p class="level0">fig2dev - translates Fig code to various graphics languages 
<p class="level0"><a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">fig2dev</span> <span Class="bold">-L</span> <span Class="emphasis">language</span> [ <span Class="bold">-m</span> <span Class="emphasis">mag</span> ] [ <span Class="bold">-f</span> <span Class="emphasis">font</span> ] [ <span Class="bold">-s</span> <span Class="emphasis">fsize</span> ] [ <span Class="emphasis">other options</span> ] [ <span Class="emphasis">fig-file</span> [ <span Class="emphasis">out-file</span> ] ] 
<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Fig2dev</span> translates fig code in the named <span Class="emphasis">fig-file</span> into the specified graphics <span Class="emphasis">language</span> and puts them in <span Class="emphasis">out-file.</span> The default <span Class="emphasis">fig-file</span> and <span Class="emphasis">out-file</span> are standard input and standard output, respectively 
<p class="level0">Xfig (Facility for Interactive Generation of figures) is a screen-oriented tool which runs under the X Window System, and allows the user to draw and manipulate objects interactively. This version of fig2dev is compatible with xfig versions 1.3, 1.4, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.2. 
<p class="level0">Xfig version 3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to edit comments for each Fig object.  These comments are output with several of the output languages, such as PostScript, CGM, EMF, LaTeX, MetaFont, PicTeX, (as % comments), tk (as &#35; comments), and pic (as .\" comments). 
<p class="level0"><a name="GENERAL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">GENERAL OPTIONS (all drivers)</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-L language</span> Set the output graphics language. Valid languages are <span class="bold">box, cgm, epic, eepic, eepicemu, emf, eps, gbx (Gerber beta driver), gif, ibmgl, jpeg, latex, map (HTML image map), mf (MetaFont), mp (MetaPost), mmp (Multi-MetaPost), pcx, pdf, pdftex, pdftex_t, pdftex_p, pic, pictex, png, ppm, ps, pstex, pstex_t, pstex_p, pstricks, ptk (Perl/tk), shape (LaTeX shaped paragraphs), sld (AutoCad slide format),  svg (beta driver), textyl, tiff, tk (tcl/tk), tpic, xbm and xpm</span>. 
<p class="level0">Notes: <br><span Class="emphasis">dvips</span> &nbsp;and <span Class="emphasis">xdvi</span> must be compiled with the tpic support (-DTPIC) for epic, eepic and tpic to work. <br>You must have ghostscript and ps2pdf, which comes with the ghostscript distribution to get the pdf output and the bitmap formats (png, jpeg, etc.), and the netpbm (pbmplus) package to get gif, xbm, xpm, and sld output. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-h</span> Print help message with all options for all output languages then exit. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-V</span> Print the program version number and exit. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-D +/-rangelist</span> With +rangelist, keep only those depths in the list.  With -rangelist, keep all depths except those in the list. The rangelist may be a list of comma-separated numbers or ranges separated by colon (:). For example, -D +10,40,55:70,80 means keep only layers 10, 40, 55 <span Class="bold">through</span> 70, and 80. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-K</span> The selection of the depths with the '-D +/-rangelist' option does normally not affect the calcualtion of the bounding box. Thus the generated document might  have a much larger bounding box than necessary. If -K is given then the  bounding box is adjusted to include only those objects in the selected depths. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f font</span> Set the default font used for text objects to <span Class="emphasis">font.</span> The default is Roman; the format of this option depends on the graphics <span Class="emphasis">language</span> in use. In TeX-based languages, the font is the base of the name given in lfonts.tex, for instance "cmr" for Roman, or "tt" for teletype. In PostScript, it is any font name known to the printer or interpreter. For Gerber it has no effect. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-G minor[:major][:unit]</span> Draws a grid on the page.  Specify thin, or thin and thick line spacing in one of several units.  For example, "-G .25:1cm" draws a thin, gray line every .25 cm and a thicker gray line every 1 cm.  Specifying "-G 1in" draws a thin line every 1 inch. Fractions may be used, e.g. "-G 1/16:1/2in" will draw a thin line every 1/16 inch (0.0625 inch) and a thick line every 1/2 inch. <br>Allowable units are: i, in, inch, f, ft, feet, c, cm, mm, and m. <br><span Class="bold">Only allowed for PostScript, EPS, PDF, and bitmap (GIF, JPEG, etc) drivers for now.</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-j</span> Enable the I18N internationalization facility. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-m mag</span> Set the magnification at which the figure is rendered to <span Class="emphasis">mag.</span> The default is 1.0. This may not be used with the maxdimension option (-Z). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s size</span> Set the default font size (in points) for text objects to <span Class="emphasis">fsize.</span> The default is 11*mag, and thus is scaled by the <span Class="bold">-m</span> option. If there is no scaling, the default font is eleven point Roman." 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Z maxdimension</span> Scale the figure so that the maximum dimension (width or height) is <span Class="emphasis">maxdimension</span> inches or cm, depending on whether the figure was saved with imperial or metric units. This may not be used with the magnification option (-m). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">other options</span> The other options are specific to the choice of graphics <span Class="emphasis">language,</span> as described below. 
<p class="level0"><a name="CGM"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CGM OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">CGM is Computer Graphics Metafile, developed by ISO and ANSI and is a vector-based plus bitmap language.  Microsoft WORD, PowerPoint and probably other products can import this format <span Class="emphasis">and display it on the screen,</span> something that they won't do with EPS files that have an ASCII preview. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-b dummyarg</span> Generate binary output (dummy argument required after the "-b"). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-r</span> Position arrowheads for CGM viewers that display rounded arrowheads. Normally, arrowheads are pointed, so fig2dev compensates for this by moving the endpoint of the line back so the tip of the arrowhead ends where the original endpoint of the line was. If the <span Class="bold">-r</span> option is used, the position of arrows will <span Class="emphasis">NOT</span> be corrected for compensating line width effects, because the rounded arrowhead doesn't extend beyond the endpoint of the line. 
<p class="level0"><a name="EMF"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EMF OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">EMF is Enhanced Metafile, developed by Microsoft and is a vector-based plus bitmap language.  Microsoft WORD, PowerPoint and probably other products can import this format <span Class="emphasis">and display it on the screen,</span> something that they won't do with EPS files that have an ASCII preview. 
<p class="level0"><a name="EPIC"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EPIC OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">EPIC is an enhancement to LaTeX picture drawing environment. It was developed by Sunil Podar of Department of Computer Science in S.U.N.Y at Stony Brook. 
<p class="level0">EEPIC is an extension to EPIC and LaTeX picture drawing environment which uses tpic specials as a graphics mechanism. It was written by Conrad Kwok of Division of Computer Science at University of California, Davis. 
<p class="level0">EEPIC-EMU is an EEPIC emulation package which does not use tpic specials. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-A factor</span> Scale arrowheads by <span Class="emphasis">factor.</span> The width and height of arrowheads is <span Class="emphasis">divided</span> by this factor.  This is because <a class="emphasis" href="#EPIC">EPIC</a> arrowheads are normally about double the size of <span Class="emphasis">TeX</span> arrowheads. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-E num</span> Set encoding for text translation (0 = none, 1 = ISO-8859-1, 2 = ISO-8859-2) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-F</span> Don't set the font face, series, and style; only set it's size and the baselineskip. By default, fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters when it  puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can't set the font from your LaTeX document. With this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX document (like "<span Class="bold">\sfshape \input picture.eepic</span>"). 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If any of the pictures included in your LaTeX document has been generated with <span Class="bold">-F</span>, then all pictures must be generated with this option. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">This option can be used only when fig2dev was compiled with NFSS defined. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-l width</span> Use "<span Class="bold">\thicklines</span>" when width of the line is wider than <span Class="emphasis">lwidth.</span> The default is 2. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-P</span> Generate a complete LaTeX file. In other words, the output file can be formatted without requiring any changes. The additional text inserted in the beginning and at the end of the file is controlled by the configuration parameter "Preamble" and "Postamble". 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-R</span> Allow rotated text. Rotated text will be set using the \rotatebox command. So, you will need to include "<span Class="bold">\usepackage{graphics}</span>" in the preamble of your LaTeX document. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If this option is not set, then rotated text will be set horizontally. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-S scale</span> Set the scale to which the figure is rendered. This option automatically sets the <span Class="emphasis">magnification</span> and size to <span Class="emphasis">scale</span> / 12 and <span Class="emphasis">scale</span> respectively. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-t stretch</span> Set the stretch factor of dashed lines to <span Class="emphasis">sretch.</span> The default is 30. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Include comments in the output file. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-W</span> Enable variable line width.  By default, only two line widths are available: The normal line width (thinlines), and thick lines (thicklines), if a line width of more than one is selected in xfig. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-w</span> Disable variable line width. Only "<span Class="bold">\thicklines</span>" and/or "<span Class="bold">\thinlines</span>" commands will be generated in the output file. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">When variable line width option is enabled, "<span Class="bold">\thinlines</span>" command is still used when line width is less than <span Class="emphasis">LineThick</span>. One potential problem is that the width of "<span Class="bold">\thinlines</span>" is 0.4pt but the resolution of Fig is 1/80 inch (approx. 1pt). If <span Class="emphasis">LineThick</span> is set to 2, normal lines will be drawn in 0.4pt wide lines but the next line width is already 2pt. One possible solution is to set <span Class="emphasis">LineThick</span> to 1 and set the width of the those lines you want to be drawn in "<span Class="bold">\thinlines</span>"  to 0. 
<p class="level1">Due to this problem, Variable line width <span Class="emphasis">VarWidth</span> is defaulted to be false. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><a name="IBM-GL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">IBM-GL (HP/GL) OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">IBM-GL (IBM Graphics Language) is compatible with HP-GL (Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-a</span> Select ISO A4 (ANSI A) paper size if the default is ANSI A (ISO A4) paper size. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-c</span> Generate instructions for an IBM 6180 Color Plotter with (without) an IBM Graphics Enhancement Cartridge (IBM-GEC). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d xll,yll,xur,yur</span> Restrict plotting to a rectangular area of the plotter paper which has a lower left hand corner at <span Class="emphasis">(xll,yll)</span> and a upper right hand corner at <span Class="emphasis">(xur,yur).</span> All four numbers are in inches and follow <span Class="bold">-d</span> in a comma-sparated list - <span Class="emphasis">xll,yll,xur,yur</span> - with no spaces between them. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f file</span> Load text character specifications from the table in the <span Class="emphasis">fonts</span> file. The table must have 36 entries - one for each font plus a default. Each entry consists of 5 numbers which specify the 1.) standard character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39), 2.) alternate character set (0 - 4, 6 - 9, 30 - 39), 3.) character slant angle (degrees), 4.) character width scale factor and 5.) character height scale factor. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-k</span> Precede output with PCL command to use HP/GL 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l pattfile</span> Load area fill line patterns from the table in the <span Class="emphasis">pattfile</span> file. The table must have 21 entries - one for each of the area fill patterns. Each entry consists of 5 numbers which specify the 1.) pattern number (-1 - 6), 2.) pattern length (inches), 3.) fill type (1 - 5), 4.) fill spacing (inches) and 5.) fill angle (degrees). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-m mag,x0,y0</span> The magnification may appear as the first element in a comma separated list - <span Class="emphasis">mag,x0,y0</span> - where the second and third parameters specify an offset in inches. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-P</span> Rotate the figure to portrait mode. The default is landscape mode. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p penfile</span> Load plotter pen specifications from the table in the <span Class="emphasis">penfile</span> file. The table must have 9 entries - one for each color plus a default. Each entry consists of 2 numbers which specify the 1.) pen number (1 - 8) and 2.) pen thickness (millimeters). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-S speed</span> Set the pen speed to <span Class="emphasis">speed</span> (centimeters/second). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Plot the figure upside-down in portrait mode or backwards in landscape mode. This allows you to write on the top surface of overhead transparencies without disturbing the plotter ink on the bottom surface. 
<p class="level0">Fig2dev may be installed with either ANSI A or ISO A4 default paper size. The <span Class="bold">-a</span> option selects the alternate paper size. Fig2dev does not fill closed splines. The IBM-GEC is required to fill other polygons. Fig2dev may be installed for plotters with or without the IBM-GEC. The <span Class="bold">-c</span> option selects the alternate instruction set. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS COMMON TO ALL BITMAP FORMATS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-b borderwidth</span> Make blank border around figure of width <span Class="emphasis">borderwidth.</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-F</span> Use correct font sizes (points, 1/72 inch) instead of the traditional size that xfig/fig2dev uses, which is (1/80 inch).  The corresponding xfig command-line option is -correct_font_size. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-g color</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">color</span> for the background. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-N</span> Convert all colors to grayscale. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-S smoothfactor</span> This will smooth the output by passing <span Class="emphasis">smoothfactor</span> to ghostscript in the  <span Class="emphasis">-dTextAlphaBits </span> and <span Class="emphasis">-dGraphicsAlphaBits</span> options to improve font rendering and graphic smoothing. A value of 2 for <span Class="emphasis">smoothfactor</span> provides some smoothing and 4 provides more. 
<p class="level0"><a name="GIF"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">GIF OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t color</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">color</span> for the transparent color in the GIF file.  This must be specified in the same format that ppmmake(1) allows. It may allow an X11 color name, but at least you may use a six-digit hexadecimal RGBvalue using the &#35; sign, e.g. &#35;ff0000 (Red). 
<p class="level0"><a name="JPEG"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">JPEG OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-q image_quality</span> use the integer value <span Class="emphasis">image_quality</span> for the JPEG "Quality" factor.  Valid values are 0-100, with the default being 75. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="LATEX"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">LATEX OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d dmag</span> Set a separate magnification for the length of line dashes to <span Class="emphasis">dmag.</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-E num</span> Set encoding for latex text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l lwidth</span> Sets the threshold between LaTeX thin and thick lines to <span Class="emphasis">lwidth</span> pixels. LaTeX supports only two different line width: \thinlines and \thicklines. Lines of width greater than <span Class="emphasis">lwidth</span> pixels are drawn as \thicklines. Also affects the size of dots in dotted line style. The default is 1. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Verbose mode. 
<p class="level0">LaTeX cannot accurately represent all the graphics objects which can be described by Fig. For example, the possible slopes which lines may have are limited. Some objects, such as spline curves, cannot be drawn at all. Fig2latex chooses the closest possible line slope, and prints error messages when objects cannot be drawn accurately 
<p class="level0"><a name="MAP"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">MAP (HTML image map) OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">Xfig version 3.2.3 and later saves and allows the user to edit comments for each Fig object. The fig2dev map output language will produce an HTML image map using Fig objects that have href="some_html_reference" in their comments. Any Fig object except compound objects may used for this. Usually, besides generating the map file, you would also generate a PNG file, which is the image to which the map refers. 
<p class="level0">For example, you may have an xfig drawing with an imported image that has the comment href="go_here.html" and a box object with a comment href="go_away.html". This will produce an image map file such the user may click on the image and the browser will load the "go_here.html" page, or click on the box and the browser will load the "go_away.html" page. 
<p class="level0">After the map file is generated by <span Class="emphasis">fig2dev</span> you will need to edit it to fill out any additional information it may need. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-b borderwidth</span> Make blank border around figure of width <span Class="emphasis">borderwidth.</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="METAFONT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">METAFONT OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">fig2dev</span> scales the figure by 1/8 before generating METAFONT code. The magnification can be further changed with the <span Class="bold">-m</span> option or by giving magnification options to <span Class="bold">mf.</span> 
<p class="level0">In order to process the generated METAFONT code, the mfpic macros must be installed where <span Class="bold">mf</span> can find them. The mfpic macro package is available at any CTAN cite under the subdirectory: graphics/mfpic 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-C code</span> specifies the starting METAFONT font code. The default is 32. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-n name</span> specifies the name to use in the output file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p pen_magnification</span> specifies how much the line width should be magnified compared to the original figure. The default is 1. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t top</span> specifies the top of the whole coordinate system. The default is <span Class="bold">ypos.</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-x xmin</span> specifies the minimum x coordinate value of the figure (inches). The default is 0. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-y ymin</span> specifies the minumum y coordinate value of the figure (inches). The default is 0. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-X xmax</span> specifies the maximum x coordinate value of the figure (inches). The default is 8. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Y ymax</span> specifies the maximum y coordinate value of the figure (inches). The default is 8. 
<p class="level0"><a name="METAPOST"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">METAPOST OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-i file</span> Include file content via \input-command. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-I file</span> Include file content as additional header. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-o</span> Old mode (no latex).

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="PIC"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PIC OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p ext</span> Enables the use of certain PIC extensions which are known to work with the groff package; compatibility with DWB PIC is unknown. The extensions enabled by each option are: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">

<br><span class="bold">allps</span>	Use all of the above (i.e. "all" + "psfont")
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="PICTEX"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PICTEX OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">In order to include PiCTeX pictures into a document, it is necessary to load the PiCTeX macros. 
<p class="level0">PiCTeX uses TeX integer register arithmetic to generate curves, and so it is very slow. PiCTeX draws curves by <span Class="bold">\put</span>-ing the <span Class="emphasis">psymbol</span> repeatedly, and so requires a large amount of TeX's internal memory, and generates large DVI files. The size of TeX's memory limits the number of plot symbols in a picture. As a result, it is best to use PiCTeX to generate small pictures. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-E num</span> Set encoding for latex text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2) 
<p class="level0"><a name="GBX"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">GBX OPTIONS (Gerber, RS-247-X) </h2>
<p class="level0">Typically you will wish to set the y scale to -1.  See <span Class="bold">-g</span> for more information. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d [mm|in]</span> Output dimensions should be assumed to be millimeters (mm) or inches (in).  The default is millimeters. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p [pos|neg]</span> Select the image polarity.  For positive images lines drawn in the fig file will generate lines of material.  For negative images lines drawn in the fig file will result in removed material.  Consider etching a chrome on glass transmission mask.  Drawing lines in the fig file and choosing 'neg' will result in these lines being etched through the chrome, leaving transparent lines. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-g &lt;x scale&gt;x&lt;y scale&gt;+&lt;x offset&gt;+&lt;y offset&gt;</span> This controls the geometry of the output, scaling the dimensions as shown and applying the given offset.  Typically you will wish to set the y scale to -1, mirroring about the x axis.  This is because Gerber assumes the origin to be bottom left, while xfig selects top left. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f &lt;n digits&gt;.&lt;n digits&gt;</span> This controls the number of digits of precision before and after the implied decimal point.  With -f 5.3 the following number 12345678 corresponds to 12345.678.  Whereas with -f 3.5 it corresponds to 123.45678.  The default is for 3 places before the decimal point and 5 after.  This corresponds, to a range of 0 to 1m in 10 micron increments. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-i [on|off]</span> Controls the output of comments describing the type of objects being output.  The text appears as comments starting with &#35;&#35; on each line in the output file.  By default this is on. 
<p class="level0"><a name="POSTSCRIPT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">POSTSCRIPT, ENCAPSULATED POSTSCRIPT (EPS), and PDF OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">With PostScript, xfig can be used to create multiple page figures  Specify the -M option to produce a multi-page output.  For posters, add -O to overlap the pages slightly to get around the problem of the unprintable area in most printers, then cut and paste the pages together. Due to memory limitations of most laser printers, the figure should not have large imported images (bitmaps). Great for text with very big letters. 
<p class="level0">The EPS driver has the following differences from PostScript: <br>
<p class="level0">o No showpage is generated because the output is meant to be imported into another program or document and not printed <br>o The landscape/portrait options are ignored <br>o The centering option is ignored <br>o The multiple-page option is ignored <br>o The paper size option is ignored <br>o The x/y offset options are ignored 
<p class="level0">The EPS driver has the following two special options: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-B 'Wx [Wy X0 Y0]'</span> This specifies that the bounding box of the EPS file should have the width Wx and the height Wy.  Note that it doesn't scale the figure to this size, it merely sets the bounding box. If a value less than or equal to 0 is specified for Wx or Wy, these are set  to the width/height respectively of the figure. Origin is relative to screen (0,0) (upper-left). Wx, Wy, X0 and Y0 are interpreted in centimeters or inches depending on the measure  given in the fig-file. Remember to put either quotes (") or apostrophes (') to group the arguments to -B. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-R 'Wx [Wy X0 Y0]'</span> Same as the -B option except that X0 and Y0 is relative to the lower  left corner of the  <span Class="bold">figure.</span> Remember to put either quotes (") or apostrophes (') to group the arguments to -R. 
<p class="level0">The PDF driver uses all the PostScript options. 
<p class="level0">Text can now include various ISO-character codes above 0x7f, which is useful for language specific characters to be printed directly. Not all ISO-characters are implemented. 
<p class="level0">Color support: Colored objects created by Fig can be printed on a color postscript printer. There are 32 standard colors: black, yellow, white, gold, five shades of blue, four shades of green, four shades of cyan, four shades of red, five shades of magenta, four shades of brown, and four shades of pink. In addition there may be user-defined colors in the file.  See the xfig FORMAT3.2 file for the definition of these colors. On a monochrome printer, colored objects will be mapped into different grayscales by the printer. Filled objects are printed using the given area fill and color. There are 21 "shades" going from black to full saturation of the fill color, and 21 more "tints" from full saturation + 1 to white. In addition, there are 16 patterns such as bricks, diagonal lines, crosshatch, etc.

<p class="level0"><a name="PSTEX"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PSTEX OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">pstex</span> language is a variant of <span Class="bold">ps</span> which suppresses formatted (special) text. The <span Class="bold">pstex_t</span> language has the complementary behavior: it generates only the LaTeX special text and the commands necessary to position special text, and to overlay the PostScript file generated using <span Class="bold">pstex.</span> These two drivers can be used to generate a figure which combines the flexibility of PostScript graphics with LaTeX text formatting of special text. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-F</span> Use correct font sizes (points) instead of the traditional size that xfig/fig2dev uses, which is 1/80 inch.  The corresponding xfig command-line option is -correct_font_size. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-g color</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">color</span> for the background. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-n name</span> sets the Title part of the PostScript output to <span Class="emphasis">name.</span> This is useful when the input to <span Class="emphasis">fig2dev</span> comes from standard input. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="PSTEXT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PSTEX_T OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The pstex_t language produces only the LaTeX special text and the commands necessary to position special text, and to overlay the PostScript file generated using <span Class="bold">pstex.</span> (see above) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-E num</span> Set encoding for latex text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-F</span> Don't set the font face, series, and style; only set it's size and the baselineskip. By default, fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters when it  puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can't set the font from your LaTeX document. With this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX document (like "<span Class="bold">\sfshape \input picture.eepic</span>"). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p file</span> specifies the name of the PostScript file to be overlaid. If not set or its value is null then no PS file will be inserted. 
<p class="level0"><a name="PSTricks"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PSTricks OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The  <a class="bold" href="#PSTricks">PSTricks </a> driver provides full <span Class="bold">LaTeX</span> text and math formatting for XFig drawings without overlaying separate outputs as in the  <a class="bold" href="#PSTEX">PSTEX </a> methods.  The output matches the quality of output of the PostScript driver except for text, where the  <span Class="bold">Latex</span> font selection mechanism is used as for other <span Class="emphasis">fig2dev</span> LaTeX drivers. In addition, text is rendered black, although font color-changing <span Class="bold">LaTex</span> code can be embedded in the drawing.   The generated PSTricks code is meant to be readable.  Each command stands alone, not relying on global option state variables.  Thus the user can easily use XFig to rough out a PSTricks drawing, then finish by hand editing. 
<p class="level0">To use the driver's output, give the command "<span Class="bold">\usepackage{pstricks}</span>" in your document preamble.  The <span Class="bold">graphicx</span> and <span Class="bold">pstricks-add</span> packages may also be required.  The former is used for bitmap graphics and the second for complex line styles and/or hollow PSTricks arrows (with the -R 1 option).  The driver will tell you which packages are needed.  In the document body, include the figure with "<span Class="bold">\input{pstfile}</span>" where <span Class="bold">pstfile.tex</span> is the output file.  Use the <span Class="bold">XFig special</span> flag to have text passed as-is to LaTeX.  For non-special text,  the same mechanism as the LaTeX and epic driver mechanism is used to match font specs, but this is imprecise. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Known bugs and limitations.</span> PSTricks support for join styles is version dependent. Raw postscript is inserted with "<span Class="bold">\pstVerb</span>" for old versions when other than angle joins are needed.  The <span Class="bold">-t</span> option controls this behavior. PSTricks does not support rotated ellipses directly, so a <span Class="bold">rput</span> command is emitted that rotates and locates a horizontal ellipse. This makes a problem with hatch patterns, which are moved and rotated along with the ellipse.  Hatch rotation is fixed by a counter-rotation, but the origin is not adjusted, so registration with adjacent hatch patterns will be incorrect.  Flipped bitmap graphics use an undocumented feature of the <span Class="bold">graphicx</span> package: a negative height flips the image vertically.  This appears to work reliably.  However, you may want to flip graphics with another program before including them in  <span Class="bold">Xfig</span> drawings just to be sure.  With the <span Class="bold">-p</span> option, the driver attempts to convert non-EPS pictures to EPS with the TeX distribution's  <span Class="bold">bmeps</span> program, but <span Class="bold">bmeps</span> does not know about very many file formats including <span Class="bold">gif.</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-G dummy_arg</span> Draws a standard PSTricks grid in light gray, ignoring the size parameters, numbered in PSTricks units. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l weight</span> Sets a line weight factor that is multiplied by the actual Fig line width.  The default value 0.5 roughly matches the output of the PS driver. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-n 0|1|2|3</span> Sets environment type.  Default 0 creates a <span Class="bold">\picture</span> environment with bounding box exactly enclosing the picture (but see <span Class="bold">-x</span> and <span Class="bold">-y</span> ).  A 1 emits bare PSTricks commands with no environment at all, which can be used with <span Class="bold">\input{commands}</span> inside an existing <span Class="bold">\pspicture</span>. A 2 emits a complete LaTeX document.  A 3 also emits a complete LaTeX document but attempts to set the PSTricks unit to fit a 7.5 by 10 inch (portrait aspect) box. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-P </span> Shorthand for <span Class="bold">-n 3</span> &nbsp;. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p dir</span> Attempts to run the <span Class="bold">bmeps</span> program to translate picture files to EPS, which is required by PSTricks.  The translated files go in  <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> , which must already exist (the driver will not create it). Moreover, (BIG CAVEAT HERE) the driver overwrites files with impunity in this directory!  Don't put your stuff here.  The <span Class="bold">includegraphics</span> commands in the output file refer to this directory.  Even if the -p option is not used,  <span Class="bold">includegrpahics</span> commands follow this convention with the default directory <span Class="emphasis">\./eps.</span> In this case, the user must do  the conversions independently.  The <span Class="bold">bmeps</span> program is part of the standard TeX distribution. It converts the following formats to EPS: <span Class="bold">png jpg pnm tif.  </span> You can see the bmeps command with the <span Class="bold">-v</span> option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-R 0|1|2</span> Sets arrow style.  With the default style 0, Fig arrows are converted to lines and polygons.  With style 1, the Fig arrowhead dimensions are converted to PSTricks arrowhead dimensions and PSTricks arrowhead options are emitted.  Hollow arrows will require the additional package  <span Class="bold">pstricks-add </span> &nbsp;. With style 2, PSTricks arrowhead options are emitted with no dimensions at all, and arrowhead size may be controlled globally with <span Class="bold">psset</span> &nbsp;. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-S scale</span> Scales the image according to the same convention as the EPIC driver, i.e., to size <span Class="emphasis">scale</span> &nbsp;/12. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t version</span> Provides the driver with PSTricks version number so  output can match expected LaTeX input.  
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Print verbose warnings and extra comments in the output file. Information provided includes font substitution details, the <span Class="bold">bmeps</span> commands used for picture conversion, if any, and one comment per Fig object in the output. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-x marginsize</span> Adds <span Class="emphasis">marginsize</span> on the left and right of the <span Class="bold">PStricks</span> bounding box.  By default, the box exactly encloses the image. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-y marginsize</span> Adds <span Class="emphasis">marginsize</span> on the top and bottom of the <span Class="bold">PStricks</span> bounding box.  By default, the box exactly encloses the image. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-z 0|1|2</span> Sets font handling option.  Default option 0 attempts to honor Fig font names and sizes, finding the best match with a standard LaTeX font.  Option 1 sets LaTeX font size only.  Option 2 issues no font commands at all. 
<p class="level0"><a name="PSTEXP"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PSTEX_P and PDFTEX_P OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">pstex_p</span> language has the same intention as the combination of <span Class="bold">pstex</span> and <span Class="bold">pstex_t</span>. The only reason to use <span Class="bold">pstex_p</span> is that you have partially overlayed texts. <span Class="bold">pstex_p</span> splits the Fig file concerning the depths of existing texts. Because of it's necessary to get the resulting size of the figure for the pdf document you have to specify the target document format (i.e. using <span Class="bold">pstex_p</span> rsp. <span Class="bold">pdftex_p</span>). <br>Two files results by using this language: <br>
<p class="level0">1) A bash script for creating and removing the necessary graphics files. Extension: <span Class="bold">.create</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">2) The latex code which includes all graphics files and special texts. Content is put to stdout. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">pstex_p</span> driver has the following special options: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p basename</span> specifies the basename of the files to be created (see (1) above). This option is mandatory. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d dmag</span> Set a separate magnification for the length of line dashes to <span Class="emphasis">dmag.</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-E num</span> Set encoding for latex text translation (0 no translation, 1 ISO-8859-1, 2 ISO-8859-2) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l lwidth</span> Sets the threshold between LaTeX thin and thick lines to <span Class="emphasis">lwidth</span> pixels. LaTeX supports only two different line width: \thinlines and \thicklines. Lines of width greater than <span Class="emphasis">lwidth</span> pixels are drawn as \thicklines. Also affects the size of dots in dotted line style. The default is 1. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Verbose mode. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-F</span> Don't set the font face, series, and style; only set it's size and the baselineskip. By default, fig2dev sets all 5 font parameters when it puts some text. The disadvantage is that you can't set the font from your LaTeX document. With this option on, you can set the font from your LaTeX document (like "<span Class="bold">\sfshape \input picture.eepic</span>").
