<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">(SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. It is intended to replace rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and 
<p class="level0">sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">connects and logs into the specified 
<p class="level0">(with optional 
<p class="level0">name). The user must prove his/her identity to the remote machine using one of several methods depending on the protocol version used (see below). 
<p class="level0">If 
<p class="level0">is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell. 
<p class="level0">The options are as follows: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Forces 
<p class="level0">to try protocol version 1 only. 
<p class="level0">Forces 
<p class="level0">to try protocol version 2 only. 
<p class="level0">Forces 
<p class="level0">to use IPv4 addresses only. 
<p class="level0">Forces 
<p class="level0">to use IPv6 addresses only. 
<p class="level0">Enables forwarding of the authentication agent connection. This can also be specified on a per-host basis in a configuration file. 
<p class="level0">Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution. Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host (for the agent's 
<p class="level0">socket) can access the local agent through the forwarded connection. An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent, however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent. 
<p class="level0">Disables forwarding of the authentication agent connection. 
<p class="level0">Use 
<p class="level0">on the local machine as the source address of the connection. Only useful on systems with more than one address. 
<p class="level0">Requests compression of all data (including stdin, stdout, stderr, and data for forwarded X11, TCP and 
<p class="level0">connections). The compression algorithm is the same used by 
<p class="level0">and the 
<p class="level0">can be controlled by the 
<p class="level0">option for protocol version 1. Compression is desirable on modem lines and other slow connections, but will only slow down things on fast networks. The default value can be set on a host-by-host basis in the configuration files; see the 
<p class="level0">option. 
<p class="level0">Selects the cipher specification for encrypting the session. 
<p class="level0">Protocol version 1 allows specification of a single cipher. The supported values are

<p class="level0">on the local side, optionally bound to the specified 
<p class="level0">Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine. Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and 
<p class="level0">will act as a SOCKS server. Only root can forward privileged ports. Dynamic port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file. 
<p class="level0">IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets. Only the superuser can forward privileged ports. By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the 
<p class="level0">setting. However, an explicit 
<p class="level0">may be used to bind the connection to a specific address. The 
<p class="level0">of

<p class="level0">Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: 
<p class="level0">The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line. The escape character followed by a dot 
<p class="level0">closes the connection; followed by control-Z suspends the connection; and followed by itself sends the escape character once. Setting the character to

<p class="level0">Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file. If a configuration file is given on the command line, the system-wide configuration file 
<p class="level0">will be ignored. The default for the per-user configuration file is

<p class="level0">Specify the PKCS&#35;11 shared library 
<p class="level0">should use to communicate with a PKCS&#35;11 token providing the user's private RSA key. 
<p class="level0">Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read. The default is 
<p class="level0">for protocol version 1, and 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">and 
<p class="level0">for protocol version 2. Identity files may also be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file. It is possible to have multiple 
<p class="level0">options (and multiple identities specified in configuration files). 
<p class="level0">will also try to load certificate information from the filename obtained by appending

<p class="level0">Additionally, for protocol version 2 a comma-separated list of MAC (message authentication code) algorithms can be specified in order of preference. See the 
<p class="level0">keyword for more information. 
<p class="level0">Do not execute a remote command. This is useful for just forwarding ports (protocol version 2 only). 
<p class="level0">Redirects stdin from 
<p class="level0">(actually, prevents reading from stdin). This must be used when 
<p class="level0">is run in the background. A common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote machine. For example, 
<p class="level0">will start an emacs on shadows.cs.hut.fi, and the X11 connection will be automatically forwarded over an encrypted channel. The 
<p class="level0">program will be put in the background. (This does not work if 
<p class="level0">needs to ask for a password or passphrase; see also the 
<p class="level0">option.) 
<p class="level0">Control an active connection multiplexing master process. When the 
<p class="level0">option is specified, the

<p class="level0">(request forwardings without command execution), 
<p class="level0">(cancel forwardings), 
<p class="level0">(request the master to exit), and

<p class="level0"><a name="AUTHENTICATION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">AUTHENTICATION</h2>
<p class="level0">The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocols 1 and 2. The default is to use protocol 2 only, though this can be changed via the 
<p class="level0">option in 
<p class="level0">or the 
<p class="level0">and 
<p class="level0">options (see above). Both protocols support similar authentication methods, but protocol 2 is the default since it provides additional mechanisms for confidentiality (the traffic is encrypted using AES, 3DES, Blowfish, CAST128, or Arcfour) and integrity (hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512, umac-64, umac-128, hmac-ripemd160). Protocol 1 lacks a strong mechanism for ensuring the integrity of the connection. 
<p class="level0">The methods available for authentication are: GSSAPI-based authentication, host-based authentication, public key authentication, challenge-response authentication, and password authentication. Authentication methods are tried in the order specified above, though protocol 2 has a configuration option to change the default order: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Host-based authentication works as follows: If the machine the user logs in from is listed in 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level0">on the remote machine, and the user names are the same on both sides, or if the files 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level0">exist in the user's home directory on the remote machine and contain a line containing the name of the client machine and the name of the user on that machine, the user is considered for login. Additionally, the server 
<p class="level0">be able to verify the client's host key (see the description of 
<p class="level0">and 
<p class="level0">below) for login to be permitted. This authentication method closes security holes due to IP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and routing spoofing. [Note to the administrator: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">and the rlogin/rsh protocol in general, are inherently insecure and should be disabled if security is desired.] 
<p class="level0">Public key authentication works as follows: The scheme is based on public-key cryptography, using cryptosystems where encryption and decryption are done using separate keys, and it is unfeasible to derive the decryption key from the encryption key. The idea is that each user creates a public/private key pair for authentication purposes. The server knows the public key, and only the user knows the private key. 
<p class="level0">implements public key authentication protocol automatically, using one of the DSA, ECDSA, ED25519 or RSA algorithms. Protocol 1 is restricted to using only RSA keys, but protocol 2 may use any. The HISTORY section of 
<p class="level0">(on non-OpenBSD systems, see 
<p class="level0"><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8&#35;HISTORY)">http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8&#35;HISTORY)</a> 
<p class="level0">contains a brief discussion of the DSA and RSA algorithms. 
<p class="level0">The file 
<p class="level0">lists the public keys that are permitted for logging in. When the user logs in, the 
<p class="level0">program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for authentication. The client proves that it has access to the private key and the server checks that the corresponding public key is authorized to accept the account. 
<p class="level0">The user creates his/her key pair by running 
<p class="level0">This stores the private key in 
<p class="level0">(protocol 1), 
<p class="level0">(protocol 2 DSA), 
<p class="level0">(protocol 2 ECDSA), 
<p class="level0">(protocol 2 ED25519), or 
<p class="level0">(protocol 2 RSA) and stores the public key in 
<p class="level0">(protocol 1), 
<p class="level0">(protocol 2 DSA), 
<p class="level0">(protocol 2 ECDSA), 
<p class="level0">(protocol 2 ED25519), or 
<p class="level0">(protocol 2 RSA) in the user's home directory. The user should then copy the public key to 
<p class="level0">in his/her home directory on the remote machine. The 
<p class="level0">file corresponds to the conventional 
<p class="level0">file, and has one key per line, though the lines can be very long. After this, the user can log in without giving the password. 
<p class="level0">A variation on public key authentication is available in the form of certificate authentication: instead of a set of public/private keys, signed certificates are used. This has the advantage that a single trusted certification authority can be used in place of many public/private keys. See the CERTIFICATES section of 
<p class="level0">for more information. 
<p class="level0">The most convenient way to use public key or certificate authentication may be with an authentication agent. See 
<p class="level0">for more information. 
<p class="level0">Challenge-response authentication works as follows: The server sends an arbitrary 
<p class="level0">text, and prompts for a response. Protocol 2 allows multiple challenges and responses; protocol 1 is restricted to just one challenge/response. Examples of challenge-response authentication include 
<p class="level0">Authentication (see 
<p class="level0">and PAM (some 
<p class="level0">systems). 
<p class="level0">Finally, if other authentication methods fail, 
<p class="level0">prompts the user for a password. The password is sent to the remote host for checking; however, since all communications are encrypted, the password cannot be seen by someone listening on the network. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">automatically maintains and checks a database containing identification for all hosts it has ever been used with. Host keys are stored in 
<p class="level0">in the user's home directory. Additionally, the file 
<p class="level0">is automatically checked for known hosts. Any new hosts are automatically added to the user's file. If a host's identification ever changes, 
<p class="level0">warns about this and disables password authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption. The 
<p class="level0">option can be used to control logins to machines whose host key is not known or has changed. 
<p class="level0">When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the server either executes the given command, or logs into the machine and gives the user a normal shell on the remote machine. All communication with the remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted. 
<p class="level0">If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated (normal login session), the user may use the escape characters noted below. 
<p class="level0">If no pseudo-tty has been allocated, the session is transparent and can be used to reliably transfer binary data. On most systems, setting the escape character to 
<p class="level0">will also make the session transparent even if a tty is used. 
<p class="level0">The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote machine exits and all X11 and TCP connections have been closed. <a name="ESCAPE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ESCAPE CHARACTERS</h2>
<p class="level0">When a pseudo-terminal has been requested, 
<p class="level0">supports a number of functions through the use of an escape character. 
<p class="level0">A single tilde character can be sent as 
<p class="level0">or by following the tilde by a character other than those described below. The escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted as special. The escape character can be changed in configuration files using the 
<p class="level0">configuration directive or on the command line by the 
<p class="level0">option. 
<p class="level0">The supported escapes (assuming the default 
<p class="level0">are: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Disconnect. 
<p class="level0">Background 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">List forwarded connections.

<p class="level0">Forwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over the secure channel can be specified either on the command line or in a configuration file. One possible application of TCP forwarding is a secure connection to a mail server; another is going through firewalls. 
<p class="level0">In the example below, we look at encrypting communication between an IRC client and server, even though the IRC server does not directly support encrypted communications. This works as follows: the user connects to the remote host using 
<p class="level0">specifying a port to be used to forward connections to the remote server. After that it is possible to start the service which is to be encrypted on the client machine, connecting to the same local port, and 
<p class="level0">will encrypt and forward the connection. 
<p class="level0">The following example tunnels an IRC session from client machine 
<p class="level0">(localhost) to remote server 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">$ ssh -f -L 1234:localhost:6667 server.example.com sleep 10 $ irc -c '&#35;users' -p 1234 pinky 127.0.0.1 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This tunnels a connection to IRC server 
<p class="level0">joining channel 
<p class="level0">nickname 
<p class="level0">using port 1234. It doesn't matter which port is used, as long as it's greater than 1023 (remember, only root can open sockets on privileged ports) and doesn't conflict with any ports already in use. The connection is forwarded to port 6667 on the remote server, since that's the standard port for IRC services. 
<p class="level0">The 
<p class="level0">option backgrounds 
<p class="level0">and the remote command 
<p class="level0">is specified to allow an amount of time (10 seconds, in the example) to start the service which is to be tunnelled. If no connections are made within the time specified, 
<p class="level0">will exit. <a name="X11"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">X11 FORWARDING</h2>
<p class="level0">If the 
<p class="level0">variable is set to 
<p class="level0">(or see the description of the 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">and 
<p class="level0">options above) and the user is using X11 (the 
<p class="level0">environment variable is set), the connection to the X11 display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any X11 programs started from the shell (or command) will go through the encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server will be made from the local machine. The user should not manually set 
<p class="level0">Forwarding of X11 connections can be configured on the command line or in configuration files. 
<p class="level0">The 
<p class="level0">value set by 
<p class="level0">will point to the server machine, but with a display number greater than zero. This is normal, and happens because 
<p class="level0">creates a 
<p class="level0">X server on the server machine for forwarding the connections over the encrypted channel. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server machine. For this purpose, it will generate a random authorization cookie, store it in Xauthority on the server, and verify that any forwarded connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real cookie when the connection is opened. The real authentication cookie is never sent to the server machine (and no cookies are sent in the plain). 
<p class="level0">If the 
<p class="level0">variable is set to 
<p class="level0">(or see the description of the 
<p class="level0">and 
<p class="level0">options above) and the user is using an authentication agent, the connection to the agent is automatically forwarded to the remote side. <a name="VERIFYING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">VERIFYING HOST KEYS</h2>
<p class="level0">When connecting to a server for the first time, a fingerprint of the server's public key is presented to the user (unless the option 
<p class="level0">has been disabled). Fingerprints can be determined using 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If the fingerprint is already known, it can be matched and the key can be accepted or rejected. Because of the difficulty of comparing host keys just by looking at hex strings, there is also support to compare host keys visually, using 
<p class="level0">By setting the 
<p class="level0">option to 
<p class="level0">a small ASCII graphic gets displayed on every login to a server, no matter if the session itself is interactive or not. By learning the pattern a known server produces, a user can easily find out that the host key has changed when a completely different pattern is displayed. Because these patterns are not unambiguous however, a pattern that looks similar to the pattern remembered only gives a good probability that the host key is the same, not guaranteed proof. 
<p class="level0">To get a listing of the fingerprints along with their random art for all known hosts, the following command line can be used: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If the fingerprint is unknown, an alternative method of verification is available: SSH fingerprints verified by DNS. An additional resource record (RR), SSHFP, is added to a zonefile and the connecting client is able to match the fingerprint with that of the key presented. 
<p class="level0">In this example, we are connecting a client to a server, 
<p class="level0">The SSHFP resource records should first be added to the zonefile for host.example.com: 
<p class="level0">$ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The output lines will have to be added to the zonefile. To check that the zone is answering fingerprint queries: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Finally the client connects: 
<p class="level0">$ ssh -o "VerifyHostKeyDNS ask" host.example.com [...] Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">contains support for Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnelling using the 
<p class="level0">network pseudo-device, allowing two networks to be joined securely. The 
<p class="level0">configuration option 
<p class="level0">controls whether the server supports this, and at what level (layer 2 or 3 traffic). 
<p class="level0">The following example would connect client network 10.0.50.0/24 with remote network 10.0.99.0/24 using a point-to-point connection from 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.2, provided that the SSH server running on the gateway to the remote network, at 192.168.1.15, allows it. 
<p class="level0">On the client: 
<p class="level0">&#35; ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true &#35; ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252 &#35; route add 10.0.99.0/24 10.1.1.2 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">On the server: 
<p class="level0">&#35; ifconfig tun1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252 &#35; route add 10.0.50.0/24 10.1.1.1 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Client access may be more finely tuned via the 
<p class="level0">file (see below) and the 
<p class="level0">server option. The following entry would permit connections on 
<p class="level0">device 1 from user 
<p class="level0">and on tun device 2 from user 
<p class="level0">if 
<p class="level0">is set to
