<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">chacl</span> is an IRIX-compatibility command, and is maintained for those users who are familiar with its use from either XFS or IRIX. Refer to the <a class="bold" href="#SEE">SEE ALSO</a> section below for a description of tools which conform more closely to the (withdrawn draft) POSIX 1003.1e standard which describes Access Control Lists (ACLs). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">chacl</span> changes the ACL(s) for a file or directory. The ACL(s) specified are applied to each file in the f4pathnamef1 arguments. 
<p class="level0">Each ACL is a string which is interpreted using the <span Class="emphasis">acl_from_text (3)</span> routine. These strings are made up of comma separated clauses each of which is of the form, tag:name:perm.  Where f4tag</span> can be: 
<p class="level0">"user" (or "u") indicating that the entry is a user ACL entry. 
<p class="level0">"group" (or "g") indicating that the entry is a group ACL entry. 
<p class="level0">"other" (or "o") indicating that the entry is an other ACL entry. 
<p class="level0">"mask" (or "m") indicating that the entry is a mask ACL entry. 
<p class="level0">f4name</span> is a string which is the user or group name for the ACL entry. A null f4name</span> in a user or group ACL entry indicates the file's owner or file's group. f4perm</span> is the string "rwx" where each of the entries may be replaced by a "-" indicating no access of that type, e.g. "r-x", "--x", "---". <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-b</span> Indicates that there are two ACLs to change, the first is the file access ACL and the second the directory default ACL. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d</span> Used to set only the default ACL of a directory.   
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-R</span> Removes the file access ACL only. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-D</span> Removes directory default ACL only. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-B</span> Remove all ACLs.  
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l</span> Lists the access ACL and possibly the default ACL associated with the specified files or directories.  This option was added during the Linux port of XFS, and is not IRIX compatible. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-r</span> Set the access ACL recursively for each subtree rooted at f4pathnamef1(s). This option was also added during the Linux port of XFS, and is not compatible with IRIX. <a name="EXAMPLES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EXAMPLES</h2>
<p class="level0">A minimum ACL: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; f3chacl u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r-- file</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The file ACL is set so that the file's owner has "rwx", the file's group has read and execute, and others have read only access to the file. 
<p class="level0">An ACL that is not a minimum ACL, that is, one that specifies a user or group other than the file's owner or owner's group, must contain a mask entry: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; f4chacl u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r--,u:bob:r--,m::r-x file1 file2</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">To set the default and access ACLs on f4newdirf1 to be the  same as on f4olddirf1, you could type: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; f4chacl -b `chacl -l olddir | \
&nbsp;     sed -e 's/.*\[//' -e 's&#35;/&#35; &#35;' -e 's/]$//'` newdir
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0"><a name="CAUTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CAUTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">chacl</span> can replace the existing ACL.  To add or delete entries, you must first do f4chacl -l</span> to get the existing ACL, and use the output to form the arguments to <span Class="emphasis">chacl .</span> 
<p class="level0">Changing the permission bits of a file will change the file access ACL settings (see <span Class="emphasis">chmod (1)).</span> However, file creation mode masks (see <span Class="emphasis">umask (1))</span> will not affect the access ACL settings of files created using directory  default ACLs.  
<p class="level0">ACLs are filesystem extended attributes and hence are not typically archived or restored using the conventional archiving utilities. See <span Class="emphasis">attr (5)</span> for more information about extended attributes and see <span Class="emphasis">xfsdump (8) </span> for a method of backing them up under XFS. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
