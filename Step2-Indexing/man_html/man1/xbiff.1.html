<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">xbiff</span> [ -<span Class="emphasis">toolkitoption</span> ... ] [ <span Class="emphasis">-option</span> ... ] <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">xbiff</span> program displays a little image of a mailbox.  When there is no mail, the flag on the mailbox is down.  When mail arrives, the flag goes up and the mailbox beeps.  By default, pressing any mouse button in the image forces <span Class="emphasis">xbiff</span> to remember the current size of the mail file as being the ``empty'' size and to lower the flag. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Xbiff</span> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along with the additional options listed below: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-help</span> This option indicates that a brief summary of the allowed options should be printed on the standard error. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-update seconds</span> This option specifies the frequency in seconds at which <span Class="emphasis">xbiff</span> should update its display.  If the mailbox is obscured and then exposed, it will be updated immediately.  The default is 30 seconds. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-file filename</span> This option specifies the name of the file which should be monitored.  By default it watches your inbox in the default location for your system (some examples are 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">(where <span Class="emphasis">username</span> is your login name).  If the MAIL environment variable is set, the file specified by it will be monitored. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-volume percentage</span> This option specifies how loud the bell should be rung when new mail comes in. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-shape</span> This option indicates that the mailbox window should be shaped if masks for the empty or full images are given. 
<p class="level0">The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used with <span Class="emphasis">xbiff:</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-display display</span> This option specifies the X server to contact. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-geometry geometry</span> This option specifies the preferred size and position of the mailbox window. The mailbox is 48 pixels wide and 48 pixels high and will be centered in the window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-bg color</span> This option specifies the color to use for the background of the window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-bd color</span> This option specifies the color to use for the border of the window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-bw number</span> This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-fg color</span> This option specifies the color to use for the foreground of the window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-rv</span> This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping the foreground and background colors. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-xrm resourcestring</span> This option specifies a resource string to be used.  This is especially useful for setting resources that do not have separate command line options. <a name="X"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">X DEFAULTS</h2>
<p class="level0">The application class name is XBiff. This program uses the <span Class="emphasis">Mailbox</span> widget. It understands all of the core resource names and classes as well as: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">checkCommand (class\fB CheckCommand)</span> Specifies a shell command to be executed to check for new mail rather than examining the size of <span Class="bold">file</span>.  The specified string value is used as the argument to a <span Class="emphasis">system</span>(3) call and may therefore contain i/o redirection. An exit status of 0 indicates that new mail is waiting, 1 indicates that there has been no change in size, and 2 indicates that the mail has been cleared. By default, no shell command is provided. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">file (class\fB File)</span> Specifies the name of the file to monitor.  The default is as described above for the <span Class="bold">-file</span> command line option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">onceOnly (class\fB Boolean)</span> Specifies that the bell is only rung the first time new mail is found and is not rung again until at least one interval has passed with no mail waiting.  The window will continue to indicate the presence of new mail until it has been retrieved.  The default is false. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">width (class\fB Width)</span> Specifies the width of the mailbox. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">height (class\fB Height)</span> Specifies the height of the mailbox. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">update (class\fB Interval)</span> Specifies the frequency in seconds at which the mail should be checked. The default is 30. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">volume (class\fB Volume)</span> Specifies how loud the bell should be rung.  The default is 33 percent. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">foreground (class\fB Foreground)</span> Specifies the color for the foreground. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">reverseVideo (class\fB ReverseVideo)</span> Specifies that the foreground and background should be reversed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">flip (class\fB Flip)</span> Specifies whether or not the image that is shown when mail has arrived should be inverted.  The default is ``true.'' 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">fullPixmap (class\fB Pixmap)</span> Specifies a bitmap to be shown when new mail has arrived. The default is flagup. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">emptyPixmap (class\fB Pixmap)</span> Specifies a bitmap to be shown when no new mail is present. The default is flagdown. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">shapeWindow (class\fB ShapeWindow)</span> Specifies whether or not the mailbox window should be shaped to the given fullPixmapMask and emptyPixmapMask.  The default is false. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">fullPixmapMask (class\fB PixmapMask)</span> Specifies a mask for the bitmap to be shown when new mail has arrived. The default is none. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">emptyPixmapMask (class\fB PixmapMask)</span> Specifies a mask for the bitmap to be shown when no new mail is present. The default is none. <a name="ACTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ACTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">Mailbox</span> widget provides the following actions for use in event translations: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">check()</span> This action causes the widget to check for new mail and display the flag appropriately. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">unset()</span> This action causes the widget to lower the flag until new mail comes in. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">set()</span> This action causes the widget to raise the flag until the user resets it. 
<p class="level0">The default translation is 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;       &lt;ButtonPress&gt;:  unset()
</pre>
