<p class="level0">This manual page documents version 5.22 of the 
<p class="level0">command. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">tests each argument in an attempt to classify it. There are three sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests, and language tests. The 
<p class="level0">test that succeeds causes the file type to be printed. 
<p class="level0">The type printed will usually contain one of the words 
<p class="level0">(the file contains only printing characters and a few common control characters and is probably safe to read on an 
<p class="level0">terminal), 
<p class="level0">(the file contains the result of compiling a program in a form understandable to some 
<p class="level0">kernel or another), or 
<p class="level0">meaning anything else (data is usually 
<p class="level0">or non-printable). Exceptions are well-known file formats (core files, tar archives) that are known to contain binary data. When adding local definitions to /etc/magic, make sure to 
<p class="level0">Users depend on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have the word 
<p class="level0">printed. Don't do as Berkeley did and change 
<p class="level0">to 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a 
<p class="level0">system call. The program checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's some sort of special file. Any known file types appropriate to the system you are running on (sockets, symbolic links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those systems that implement them) are intuited if they are defined in the system header file 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats. The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled program) 
<p class="level0">file, whose format is defined in 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">and possibly 
<p class="level0">in the standard include directory. These files have a 
<p class="level0">stored in a particular place near the beginning of the file that tells the 
<p class="level0">operating system that the file is a binary executable, and which of several types thereof. The concept of a 
<p class="level0">has been applied by extension to data files. Any file with some invariant identifier at a small fixed offset into the file can usually be described in this way. The information identifying these files is read from /etc/magic and the compiled magic file 
<p class="level0">or the files in the directory 
<p class="level0">if the compiled file does not exist. In addition, if 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level0">exists, it will be used in preference to the system magic files. 
<p class="level0">If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see if it seems to be a text file. ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII character sets (such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the different ranges and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set. If a file passes any of these tests, its character set is reported. ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as 
<p class="level0">because they will be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only 
<p class="level0">because, while they contain text, it is text that will require translation before it can be read. In addition, 
<p class="level0">will attempt to determine other characteristics of text-type files. If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead of the Unix-standard LF, this will be reported. Files that contain embedded escape sequences or overstriking will also be identified. 
<p class="level0">Once 
<p class="level0">has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it will attempt to determine in what language the file is written. The language tests look for particular strings (cf. 
<p class="level0">that can appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a file. For example, the keyword 
<p class="level0">indicates that the file is most likely a 
<p class="level0">input file, just as the keyword 
<p class="level0">indicates a C program. These tests are less reliable than the previous two groups, so they are performed last. The language test routines also test for some miscellany (such as 
<p class="level0">archives). 
<p class="level0">Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the character sets listed above is simply said to be

<p class="level0">Causes the file command to output the file type and creator code as used by older MacOS versions. The code consists of eight letters, the first describing the file type, the latter the creator. 
<p class="level0">Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode). 
<p class="level0">Write a 
<p class="level0">output file that contains a pre-parsed version of the magic file or directory. 
<p class="level0">Cause a checking printout of the parsed form of the magic file. This is usually used in conjunction with the 
<p class="level0">flag to debug a new magic file before installing it. 
<p class="level0">On filesystem errors (file not found etc), instead of handling the error as regular output as POSIX mandates and keep going, issue an error message and exit. 
<p class="level0">Exclude the test named in 
<p class="level0">from the list of tests made to determine the file type. Valid test names are: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">application type (only on EMX). 
<p class="level0">Various types of text files (this test will try to guess the text encoding, irrespective of the setting of the 
<p class="level0">option). 
<p class="level0">Different text encodings for soft magic tests. 
<p class="level0">Ignored for backwards compatibility.

<p class="level0">Read the names of the files to be examined from 
<p class="level0">(one per line) before the argument list. Either 
<p class="level0">or at least one filename argument must be present; to test the standard input, use 
<p class="level0">as a filename argument. Please note that  
<p class="level0">is unwrapped and the enclosed filenames are processed when this option is encountered and before any further options processing is done. This allows one to process multiple lists of files with different command line arguments on the same 
<p class="level0">invocation. Thus if you want to set the delimiter, you need to do it before you specify the list of files, like:

<p class="level0">option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that support symbolic links). This is the default if the environment variable 
<p class="level0">is not defined. 
<p class="level0">Causes the file command to output mime type strings rather than the more traditional human readable ones. Thus it may say 
<p class="level0">rather than

<p class="level0">Don't stop at the first match, keep going. Subsequent matches will be have the string 
<p class="level0">prepended. (If you want a newline, see the 
<p class="level0">option.) The magic pattern with the highest strength (see the 
<p class="level0">option) comes first. 
<p class="level0">Shows a list of patterns and their strength sorted descending by 
<p class="level0">strength which is used for the matching (see also the

<p class="level0">option causes symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option in 
<p class="level0">(on systems that support symbolic links). This is the default if the environment variable 
<p class="level0">is defined. 
<p class="level0">Specify an alternate list of files and directories containing magic. This can be a single item, or a colon-separated list. If a compiled magic file is found alongside a file or directory, it will be used instead. 
<p class="level0">Don't pad filenames so that they align in the output. 
<p class="level0">Force stdout to be flushed after checking each file. This is only useful if checking a list of files. It is intended to be used by programs that want filetype output from a pipe. 
<p class="level0">On systems that support

<p class="level0">to also read argument files which are block or character special files. This is useful for determining the filesystem types of the data in raw disk partitions, which are block special files. This option also causes 
<p class="level0">to disregard the file size as reported by 
<p class="level0">since on some systems it reports a zero size for raw disk partitions. 
<p class="level0">Print the version of the program and exit.

<p class="level0">This program is believed to exceed the System V Interface Definition of FILE(CMD), as near as one can determine from the vague language contained therein. Its behavior is mostly compatible with the System V program of the same name. This version knows more magic, however, so it will produce different (albeit more accurate) output in many cases. 
<p class="level0">The one significant difference between this version and System V is that this version treats any white space as a delimiter, so that spaces in pattern strings must be escaped. For example, 
<p class="level0">*[Gt]10	string	language impress&nbsp;	(imPRESS data) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">in an existing magic file would have to be changed to 
<p class="level0">*[Gt]10	string	languagee impress	(imPRESS data) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In addition, in this version, if a pattern string contains a backslash, it must be escaped. For example 
<p class="level0">0	string		ebegindata	Andrew Toolkit document 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">in an existing magic file would have to be changed to 
<p class="level0">0	string		eebegindata	Andrew Toolkit document 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">SunOS releases 3.2 and later from Sun Microsystems include a 
<p class="level0">command derived from the System V one, but with some extensions. This version differs from Sun's only in minor ways. It includes the extension of the 
<p class="level0">operator, used as, for example, 
<p class="level0">*[Gt]16	long*[Am]0x7fffffff	*[Gt]0		not stripped

<p class="level0">There has been a 
<p class="level0">command in every 
<p class="level0">(man page dated November, 1973). The System V version introduced one significant major change: the external list of magic types. This slowed the program down slightly but made it a lot more flexible. 
<p class="level0">This program, based on the System V version, was written by Ian Darwin 
<p class="level0">without looking at anybody else's source code. 
<p class="level0">John Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it better than the first version. Geoff Collyer found several inadequacies and provided some magic file entries. Contributions by the 
<p class="level0">operator by Rob McMahon,

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Fix output so that tests for MIME and APPLE flags are not needed all over the place, and actual output is only done in one place. This needs a design. Suggestion: push possible outputs on to a list, then pick the last-pushed (most specific, one hopes) value at the end, or use a default if the list is empty. This should not slow down evaluation. 
<p class="level0">Continue to squash all magic bugs. See Debian BTS for a good source. 
<p class="level0">Store arbitrarily long strings, for example for %s patterns, so that they can be printed out. Fixes Debian bug &#35;271672. Would require more complex store/load code in apprentice. 
<p class="level0">Add syntax for relative offsets after current level (Debian bug &#35;466037). 
<p class="level0">Make file -ki work, i.e. give multiple MIME types. 
<p class="level0">Add a zip library so we can peek inside Office2007 documents to figure out what they are. 
<p class="level0">Add an option to print URLs for the sources of the file descriptions. 
<p class="level0">Combine script searches and add a way to map executable names to MIME types (e.g. have a magic value for !:mime which causes the resulting string to be looked up in a table). This would avoid adding the same magic repeatedly for each new hash-bang interpreter. 
<p class="level0">Fix

<p class="level0">
