<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">mev</span> [ <span Class="emphasis">options</span> ] <br><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">The `mev' program is part of the gpm package. The information below is extracted from the texinfo file, which is the preferred source of information. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The `mev' program is modeled after `xev'. It prints to `stdout' the mouse console events it gets. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">`mev''s default behaviour is to get anything, but command line switches can be used to set the various fields in the `Gpm_Connect' structure, in order to customize the program's behaviour. I'm using `mev' to handle mouse events to Emacs. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Command line switches for `mev' are the following: 
<p class="level0">-C <span Class="emphasis">number</span> Select a virtual console to get events from. This is intended to be used for debugging. 
<p class="level0">-d <span Class="emphasis">number</span> Choose a default mask. By default the server gets any events not belonging to the event mask. The mask can be provided either as a decimal number, or as a symbolic string. 
<p class="level0">-e <span Class="emphasis">number</span> Choose the event mask. By default any event is received. The mask can be provided either as a decimal number, or as a symbolic string. 
<p class="level0">-E Enter emacs mode. In emacs mode events are reported as lisp forms rather than numbers. This is the format used by the t-mouse package within emacs. 
<p class="level0">-f Fit events inside the screen before reporting them. This options re-fits drag events, which are allowed to exit the screen border, 
<p class="level0">-i Interactive. Accepts input from `stdin' to change connection parameters. 
<p class="level0">-m <span Class="emphasis">number</span> Choose the minimum modifier mask. Any event with fewer modifiers will not be reported to `mev'. It defaults to `0'. The mask must be provided either as a decimal number, or as a symbolic string. 
<p class="level0">-M <span Class="emphasis">number</span> Choose the maximum modifier mask. Any event with more modifier than specified will not be reported to `mev'. It defaults to `~~0', i.e. all events are received. The mask must be provided either as a decimal number, or as a symbolic string. 
<p class="level0">-p Requests to draw the pointer during drags. This option is used by emacs to avoid invoking `ioctl()' from lisp code. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When the arguments are not decimal integers, they are considered lists of alphanumeric characters, separated by a single non-alphanumeric character. I use the comma (`,'), but any will do. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Allowed names for events are `move', `drag', `down' or `press', `up' or `release', `motion' (which is both `move' and `drag'), and `hard'. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Allowed names for modifiers are `shift', `leftAlt', `rightAlt', `anyAlt' (one or the other), `control'. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When the `-i' switch is specified, `mev' looks at its standard input as command lines rather than events. The input lines are parsed, and the commands `push' and `pop' are recognized. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The `push' command, then, accepts the options `-d', `-e', `-m' and `-M', with the same meaning described above. Unspecified options retain the previous value and the resulting masks are used to reopen the connection with the server. `pop' is used to pop the connection stack. If an empty stack is popped the program exits. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Other commands recognized are `info', used to return the stack depth; `quit' to prematurely terminate the program; and `snapshot' to get some configuration information from the server. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="BUGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">BUGS</h2>
<p class="level0">Beginning with release 1.16, <span Class="bold">mev</span> no longer works under xterm. Please use the <span Class="bold">rmev</span> program (provided in the <span Class="bold">sample</span> directory) to watch gpm events under xterm or rxvt.  <span Class="bold">rmev</span> also displays keyboard events besides mouse events.
