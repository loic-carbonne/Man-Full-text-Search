<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">xscreensaver-getimage</span> [-display <span Class="emphasis">host:display.screen</span>] [--verbose] window-id [pixmap-id] <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-getimage</span> program is a helper program for the xscreensaver hacks that manipulate images.  This is not a user-level command. 
<p class="level0">This program selects a random image, and puts it on the specified window or pixmap.  This image might be a snapshot of the desktop; or a frame captured from the system's video input; or a randomly-selected image from disk. 
<p class="level0">If only a window ID is specified, the image will be painted there. If both a window ID and a pixmap ID are specified, then the image will be painted on the pixmap; and the window <span Class="emphasis">may</span> be modified as a side-effect. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-getimage</span> reads the <span Class="emphasis">~/.xscreensaver</span> file for configuration information. It uses these settings: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">grabDesktopImages</span> Whether it is acceptable to grab snapshots of the desktop. The security paranoid might want to turn this off, to avoid letting people see (but not touch!) your desktop while the screen is locked. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">grabVideoFrames</span> Whether it is acceptable to grab frames of video from the system's video input.  Grabbing of video is done by invoking the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-getimage-video (1)</span>program. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">chooseRandomImages</span> Whether it is acceptable to display random images found on disk. Selection and loading of images is done by invoking the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-getimage-file (1)</span>program. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">imageDirectory</span> When loading images from disk, this is the directory to find them in. The directory will be searched recursively for images. 
<p class="level0">It may also be the URL of an RSS or Atom feed, in which case a random image from that feed will be selected instead.  The contents of the feed will be cached locally and refreshed periodically as needed. 
<p class="level0">If none of the three options are set to True, then video colorbars will be displayed instead. <a name="BUGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">BUGS</h2>
<p class="level0">When grabbing desktop images, the <span Class="emphasis">window</span> argument will be unmapped and have its contents modified, causing flicker.  (This does not happen when loading image files or video frames.) <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
