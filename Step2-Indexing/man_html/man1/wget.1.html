<p class="level0">Wget - The non-interactive network downloader. <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">wget [<span Class="emphasis">option</span>]... [<span Class="emphasis">s-1URLs0</span>]... <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">s-1GNUs0 Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web.  It supports s-1HTTP, HTTPS,s0 and s-1FTPs0 protocols, as well as retrieval through s-1HTTPs0 proxies. 
<p class="level0">Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of data. 
<p class="level0">Wget can follow links in s-1HTML, XHTML,s0 and s-1CSSs0 pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as *(L"recursive downloading.*(R"  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (<span Class="emphasis">/robots.txt</span>).  Wget can be instructed to convert the links in downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing. 
<p class="level0">Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download from where it left off. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="Option"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Option Syntax</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Since Wget uses s-1GNUs0 getopt to process command-line arguments, every option has a long form along with the short one.  Long options are more convenient to remember, but take time to type.  You may freely mix different option styles, or specify options after the command-line arguments.  Thus you may write: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">&nbsp;       wget -r --tries=10 <a href="http://fly.srk.fer.hr/">http://fly.srk.fer.hr/</a> -o log 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument may be omitted.  Instead of <span Class="bold">-o log</span> you can write <span Class="bold">-olog</span>. 
<p class="level0">You may put several options that do not require arguments together, like: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">&nbsp;       wget -drc &lt;URL&gt; 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This is completely equivalent to: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">&nbsp;       wget -d -r -c &lt;URL&gt; 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Since the options can be specified after the arguments, you may terminate them with <span Class="bold">--</span>.  So the following will try to download s-1URL s0<span Class="bold">-x</span>, reporting failure to <span Class="emphasis">log</span>: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">&nbsp;       wget -o log -- -x 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The options that accept comma-separated lists all respect the convention that specifying an empty list clears its value.  This can be useful to clear the <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span> settings.  For instance, if your <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span> sets f(CW*(C`exclude_directories*(C'</span> to <span Class="emphasis">/cgi-bin</span>, the following example will first reset it, and then set it to exclude <span Class="emphasis">/~nobody</span> and <span Class="emphasis">/~somebody</span>.  You can also clear the lists in <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">&nbsp;       wget -X " -X /~nobody,/~somebody 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Most options that do not accept arguments are <span Class="emphasis">boolean</span> options, so named because their state can be captured with a yes-or-no (*(L"boolean*(R") variable.  For example, <span Class="bold">--follow-ftp</span> tells Wget to follow s-1FTPs0 links from s-1HTMLs0 files and, on the other hand, <span Class="bold">--no-glob</span> tells it not to perform file globbing on s-1FTPs0 URLs.  A boolean option is either <span Class="emphasis">affirmative</span> or <span Class="emphasis">negative</span> (beginning with <span Class="bold">--no</span>).  All such options share several properties. 
<p class="level0">Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that the default behavior is the opposite of what the option accomplishes.  For example, the documented existence of <span Class="bold">--follow-ftp</span> assumes that the default is to <span Class="emphasis">not</span> follow s-1FTPs0 links from s-1HTMLs0 pages. 
<p class="level0">Affirmative options can be negated by prepending the <span Class="bold">--no-</span> to the option name; negative options can be negated by omitting the <span Class="bold">--no-</span> prefix.  This might seem superfluous---if the default for an affirmative option is to not do something, then why provide a way to explicitly turn it off?  But the startup file may in fact change the default.  For instance, using f(CW*(C`follow_ftp = on*(C'</span> in <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span> makes Wget <span Class="emphasis">follow</span> s-1FTPs0 links by default, and using <span Class="bold">--no-follow-ftp</span> is the only way to restore the factory default from the command line. <a name="Basic"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Basic Startup Options</h2>

<p class="level1">However, if you specify <span Class="bold">--force-html</span>, the document will be regarded as <span Class="bold">html</span>.

<p class="level1">If the <span Class="emphasis">file</span> is an external one, the document will be automatically treated as <span Class="bold">html</span> if the Content-Type matches <span Class="bold">text/html</span>.

This is equivalent to the presence of a f(CW*(C`BASE*(C'</span> tag in the s-1HTMLs0 input file, with <span Class="emphasis">s-1URLs0</span> as the value for the f(CW*(C`href*(C'</span> attribute. 
<p class="level1">For instance, if you specify <span Class="bold">http://foo/bar/a.html</span> for <span Class="emphasis">s-1URLs0</span>, and Wget reads <span Class="bold">../baz/b.html</span> from the input file, it would be resolved to <span Class="bold">http://foo/baz/b.html</span>.

<p class="level1">The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all will be concatenated together and written to <span Class="emphasis">file</span>.  If <span Class="bold">-</span> is used as <span Class="emphasis">file</span>, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling link conversion.  (Use <span Class="bold">./-</span> to print to a file literally named <span Class="bold">-</span>.) 
<p class="level1">Use of <span Class="bold">-O</span> is <span Class="emphasis">not</span> intended to mean simply "use the name <span Class="emphasis">file</span> instead of the one in the s-1URLs0;" rather, it is analogous to shell redirection: <span Class="bold">wget -O file <a href="http://foo">http://foo</a></span> is intended to work like <span Class="bold">wget -O - <a href="http://foo">http://foo</a> &gt; file</span>; <span Class="emphasis">file</span> will be truncated immediately, and <span Class="emphasis">all</span> downloaded content will be written there. 
<p class="level1">For this reason, <span Class="bold">-N</span> (for timestamp-checking) is not supported in combination with <span Class="bold">-O</span>: since <span Class="emphasis">file</span> is always newly created, it will always have a very new timestamp. A warning will be issued if this combination is used. 
<p class="level1">Similarly, using <span Class="bold">-r</span> or <span Class="bold">-p</span> with <span Class="bold">-O</span> may not work as you expect: Wget won't just download the first file to <span Class="emphasis">file</span> and then download the rest to their normal names: <span Class="emphasis">all</span> downloaded content will be placed in <span Class="emphasis">file</span>. This was disabled in version 1.11, but has been reinstated (with a warning) in 1.11.2, as there are some cases where this behavior can actually have some use. 
<p class="level1">Note that a combination with <span Class="bold">-k</span> is only permitted when downloading a single document, as in that case it will just convert all relative URIs to external ones; <span Class="bold">-k</span> makes no sense for multiple URIs when they're all being downloaded to a single file; <span Class="bold">-k</span> can be used only when the output is a regular file.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory, Wget's behavior depends on a few options, including <span Class="bold">-nc</span>.  In certain cases, the local file will be <span Class="emphasis">clobbered</span>, or overwritten, upon repeated download.  In other cases it will be preserved. 
<p class="level1">When running Wget without <span Class="bold">-N</span>, <span Class="bold">-nc</span>, <span Class="bold">-r</span>, or <span Class="bold">-p</span>, downloading the same file in the same directory will result in the original copy of <span Class="emphasis">file</span> being preserved and the second copy being named <span Class="emphasis">file</span><a class="bold" href="#1">.1</a>.  If that file is downloaded yet again, the third copy will be named <span Class="emphasis">file</span><a class="bold" href="#2">.2</a>, and so on. (This is also the behavior with <span Class="bold">-nd</span>, even if <span Class="bold">-r</span> or <span Class="bold">-p</span> are in effect.)  When <span Class="bold">-nc</span> is specified, this behavior is suppressed, and Wget will refuse to download newer copies of <span Class="emphasis">file</span>.  Therefore, "f(CW*(C`no-clobber*(C'</span>" is actually a misnomer in this mode---it's not clobbering that's prevented (as the numeric suffixes were already preventing clobbering), but rather the multiple version saving that's prevented. 
<p class="level1">When running Wget with <span Class="bold">-r</span> or <span Class="bold">-p</span>, but without <span Class="bold">-N</span>, <span Class="bold">-nd</span>, or <span Class="bold">-nc</span>, re-downloading a file will result in the new copy simply overwriting the old.  Adding <span Class="bold">-nc</span> will prevent this behavior, instead causing the original version to be preserved and any newer copies on the server to be ignored. 
<p class="level1">When running Wget with <span Class="bold">-N</span>, with or without <span Class="bold">-r</span> or <span Class="bold">-p</span>, the decision as to whether or not to download a newer copy of a file depends on the local and remote timestamp and size of the file.  <span Class="bold">-nc</span> may not be specified at the same time as <span Class="bold">-N</span>. 
<p class="level1">Note that when <span Class="bold">-nc</span> is specified, files with the suffixes <span Class="bold">.html</span> or <span Class="bold">.htm</span> will be loaded from the local disk and parsed as if they had been retrieved from the Web.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       wget -c <a href="ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z">ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/ls-lR.Z</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">If there is a file named <span Class="emphasis">ls-lR.Z</span> in the current directory, Wget will assume that it is the first portion of the remote file, and will ask the server to continue the retrieval from an offset equal to the length of the local file. 
<p class="level1">Note that you don't need to specify this option if you just want the current invocation of Wget to retry downloading a file should the connection be lost midway through.  This is the default behavior. <span Class="bold">-c</span> only affects resumption of downloads started <span Class="emphasis">prior</span> to this invocation of Wget, and whose local files are still sitting around. 
<p class="level1">Without <span Class="bold">-c</span>, the previous example would just download the remote file to <span Class="emphasis">ls-lR.Z.1</span>, leaving the truncated <span Class="emphasis">ls-lR.Z</span> file alone. 
<p class="level1">Beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <span Class="bold">-c</span> on a non-empty file, and it turns out that the server does not support continued downloading, Wget will refuse to start the download from scratch, which would effectively ruin existing contents.  If you really want the download to start from scratch, remove the file. 
<p class="level1">Also beginning with Wget 1.7, if you use <span Class="bold">-c</span> on a file which is of equal size as the one on the server, Wget will refuse to download the file and print an explanatory message.  The same happens when the file is smaller on the server than locally (presumably because it was changed on the server since your last download attempt)---because *(L"continuing*(R" is not meaningful, no download occurs. 
<p class="level1">On the other side of the coin, while using <span Class="bold">-c</span>, any file that's bigger on the server than locally will be considered an incomplete download and only f(CW*(C`(length(remote) - length(local))*(C'</span> bytes will be downloaded and tacked onto the end of the local file.  This behavior can be desirable in certain cases---for instance, you can use <span Class="bold">wget -c</span> to download just the new portion that's been appended to a data collection or log file. 
<p class="level1">However, if the file is bigger on the server because it's been <span Class="emphasis">changed</span>, as opposed to just <span Class="emphasis">appended</span> to, you'll end up with a garbled file.  Wget has no way of verifying that the local file is really a valid prefix of the remote file.  You need to be especially careful of this when using <span Class="bold">-c</span> in conjunction with <span Class="bold">-r</span>, since every file will be considered as an *(L"incomplete download*(R" candidate. 
<p class="level1">Another instance where you'll get a garbled file if you try to use <span Class="bold">-c</span> is if you have a lame s-1HTTPs0 proxy that inserts a *(L"transfer interrupted*(R" string into the local file.  In the future a *(L"rollback*(R" option may be added to deal with this case. 
<p class="level1">Note that <span Class="bold">-c</span> only works with s-1FTPs0 servers and with s-1HTTPs0 servers that support the f(CW*(C`Range*(C'</span> header.

When <span Class="bold">--start-pos</span> and <span Class="bold">--continue</span> are both specified, wget will emit a warning then proceed as if <span Class="bold">--continue</span> was absent. 
<p class="level1">Server support for continued download is required, otherwise <span Class="bold">--start-pos</span> cannot help.  See <span Class="bold">-c</span> for details.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Select the type of the progress indicator you wish to use.  Legal indicators are *(L"dot*(R" and *(L"bar*(R". 
<p class="level1">The *(L"bar*(R" indicator is used by default.  It draws an s-1ASCIIs0 progress bar graphics (a.k.a *(L"thermometer*(R" display) indicating the status of retrieval.  If the output is not a s-1TTY,s0 the *(L"dot*(R" bar will be used by default. 
<p class="level1">Use <span Class="bold">--progress=dot</span> to switch to the *(L"dot*(R" display.  It traces the retrieval by printing dots on the screen, each dot representing a fixed amount of downloaded data. 
<p class="level1">The progress <span Class="emphasis">type</span> can also take one or more parameters.  The parameters vary based on the <span Class="emphasis">type</span> selected.  Parameters to <span Class="emphasis">type</span> are passed by appending them to the type sperated by a colon (:) like this: <span Class="bold">--progress=</span><span Class="emphasis">type</span><span Class="bold">:</span><span Class="emphasis">parameter1</span><span Class="bold">:</span><span Class="emphasis">parameter2</span>. 
<p class="level1">When using the dotted retrieval, you may set the <span Class="emphasis">style</span> by specifying the type as <span Class="bold">dot:</span><span Class="emphasis">style</span>.  Different styles assign different meaning to one dot.  With the f(CW*(C`default*(C'</span> style each dot represents 1K, there are ten dots in a cluster and 50 dots in a line. The f(CW*(C`binary*(C'</span> style has a more *(L"computer*(R"-like orientation---8K dots, 16-dots clusters and 48 dots per line (which makes for 384K lines).  The f(CW*(C`mega*(C'</span> style is suitable for downloading large files---each dot represents 64K retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 48 dots on each line (so each line contains 3M). If f(CW*(C`mega*(C'</span> is not enough then you can use the f(CW*(C`giga*(C'</span> style---each dot represents 1M retrieved, there are eight dots in a cluster, and 32 dots on each line (so each line contains 32M). 
<p class="level1">With <span Class="bold">--progress=bar</span>, there are currently two possible parameters, <span Class="emphasis">force</span> and <span Class="emphasis">noscroll</span>. 
<p class="level1">When the output is not a s-1TTY,s0 the progress bar always falls back to *(L"dot*(R", even if <span Class="bold">--progress=bar</span> was passed to Wget during invokation. This behaviour can be overridden and the *(L"bar*(R" output forced by using the *(L"force*(R" parameter as <span Class="bold">--progress=bar:force</span>. 
<p class="level1">By default, the <span Class="bold">bar</span> style progress bar scroll the name of the file from left to right for the file being downloaded if the filename exceeds the maximum length allotted for its display.  In certain cases, such as with <span Class="bold">--progress=bar:force</span>, one may not want the scrolling filename in the progress bar.  By passing the *(L"noscroll*(R" parameter, Wget can be forced to display as much of the filename as possible without scrolling through it. 
<p class="level1">Note that you can set the default style using the f(CW*(C`progress*(C'</span> command in <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span>.  That setting may be overridden from the command line.  For example, to force the bar output without scrolling, use <span Class="bold">--progress=bar:force:noscroll</span>.

One may however want wget to display the progress bar on screen in conjunction with any other verbosity modes like <span Class="bold">--no-verbose</span> or <span Class="bold">--quiet</span>.  This is often a desired a property when invoking wget to download several small/large files.  In such a case, wget could simply be invoked with this parameter to get a much cleaner output on the screen.

<p class="level1">When interacting with the network, Wget can check for timeout and abort the operation if it takes too long.  This prevents anomalies like hanging reads and infinite connects.  The only timeout enabled by default is a 900-second read timeout.  Setting a timeout to 0 disables it altogether.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best not to change the default timeout settings. 
<p class="level1">All timeout-related options accept decimal values, as well as subsecond values.  For example, <span Class="bold">0.1</span> seconds is a legal (though unwise) choice of timeout.  Subsecond timeouts are useful for checking server response times or for testing network latency.

<p class="level1">Note that Wget implements the limiting by sleeping the appropriate amount of time after a network read that took less time than specified by the rate.  Eventually this strategy causes the s-1TCPs0 transfer to slow down to approximately the specified rate.  However, it may take some time for this balance to be achieved, so don't be surprised if limiting the rate doesn't work well with very small files.

<p class="level1">Specifying a large value for this option is useful if the network or the destination host is down, so that Wget can wait long enough to reasonably expect the network error to be fixed before the retry.

<p class="level1">Note that quota will never affect downloading a single file.  So if you specify <span Class="bold">wget -Q10k <a href="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz">ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/ls-lR.gz</a></span>, all of the <span Class="emphasis">ls-lR.gz</span> will be downloaded.  The same goes even when several URLs are specified on the command-line.  However, quota is respected when retrieving either recursively, or from an input file. Thus you may safely type <span Class="bold">wget -Q2m -i sites</span>---download will be aborted when the quota is exceeded.

<p class="level1">Turn off caching of s-1DNSs0 lookups.  Normally, Wget remembers the s-1IPs0 addresses it looked up from s-1DNSs0 so it doesn't have to repeatedly contact the s-1DNSs0 server for the same (typically small) set of hosts it retrieves from.  This cache exists in memory only; a new Wget run will contact s-1DNSs0 again. 
<p class="level1">However, it has been reported that in some situations it is not desirable to cache host names, even for the duration of a short-running application like Wget.  With this option Wget issues a new s-1DNSs0 lookup (more precisely, a new call to f(CW*(C`gethostbyname*(C'</span> or f(CW*(C`getaddrinfo*(C'</span>) each time it makes a new connection.  Please note that this option will <span Class="emphasis">not</span> affect caching that might be performed by the resolving library or by an external caching layer, such as s-1NSCD.s0

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Change which characters found in remote URLs must be escaped during generation of local filenames.  Characters that are <span Class="emphasis">restricted</span> by this option are escaped, i.e. replaced with <span class="bold">f(CB%HH<span Class="bold"></span>, where <span Class="bold">s-1HHs0</span> is the hexadecimal number that corresponds to the restricted character. This option may also be used to force all alphabetical cases to be either lower- or uppercase. 
<p class="level1">By default, Wget escapes the characters that are not valid or safe as part of file names on your operating system, as well as control characters that are typically unprintable.  This option is useful for changing these defaults, perhaps because you are downloading to a non-native partition, or because you want to disable escaping of the control characters, or you want to further restrict characters to only those in the s-1ASCIIs0 range of values. 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="emphasis">modes</span> are a comma-separated set of text values. The acceptable values are <span Class="bold">unix</span>, <span Class="bold">windows</span>, <span Class="bold">nocontrol</span>, <span Class="bold">ascii</span>, <span Class="bold">lowercase</span>, and <span Class="bold">uppercase</span>. The values <span Class="bold">unix</span> and <span Class="bold">windows</span> are mutually exclusive (one will override the other), as are <span Class="bold">lowercase</span> and <span Class="bold">uppercase</span>. Those last are special cases, as they do not change the set of characters that would be escaped, but rather force local file paths to be converted either to lower- or uppercase. 
<p class="level1">When *(L"unix*(R" is specified, Wget escapes the character <span Class="bold">/</span> and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159.  This is the default on Unix-like operating systems. 
<p class="level1">When *(L"windows*(R" is given, Wget escapes the characters <span Class="bold">e</span>, <span Class="bold">|</span>, <span Class="bold">/</span>, <span Class="bold">:</span>, <span Class="bold">?</span>, <span Class="bold">"</span>, <span Class="bold">*</span>, <span Class="bold">&lt;</span>, <span Class="bold">&gt;</span>, and the control characters in the ranges 0--31 and 128--159. In addition to this, Wget in Windows mode uses <span Class="bold">+</span> instead of <span Class="bold">:</span> to separate host and port in local file names, and uses <span Class="bold">@</span> instead of <span Class="bold">?</span> to separate the query portion of the file name from the rest.  Therefore, a s-1URLs0 that would be saved as <span Class="bold">www.xemacs.org:4300/search.pl?input=blah</span> in Unix mode would be saved as <span Class="bold">www.xemacs.org+4300/search.pl@input=blah</span> in Windows mode.  This mode is the default on Windows. 
<p class="level1">If you specify <span Class="bold">nocontrol</span>, then the escaping of the control characters is also switched off. This option may make sense when you are downloading URLs whose names contain s-1UTF-8s0 characters, on a system which can save and display filenames in s-1UTF-8 s0(some possible byte values used in s-1UTF-8s0 byte sequences fall in the range of values designated by Wget as *(L"controls*(R"). 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="bold">ascii</span> mode is used to specify that any bytes whose values are outside the range of s-1ASCIIs0 characters (that is, greater than 127) shall be escaped. This can be useful when saving filenames whose encoding does not match the one used locally.

Conversely, with <span Class="bold">--inet6-only</span> or <span Class="bold">-6</span>, Wget will only connect to IPv6 hosts and ignore A records and IPv4 addresses. 
<p class="level1">Neither options should be needed normally.  By default, an IPv6-aware Wget will use the address family specified by the host's s-1DNSs0 record. If the s-1DNSs0 responds with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, Wget will try them in sequence until it finds one it can connect to.  (Also see f(CW*(C`--prefer-family*(C'</span> option described below.) 
<p class="level1">These options can be used to deliberately force the use of IPv4 or IPv6 address families on dual family systems, usually to aid debugging or to deal with broken network configuration.

<p class="level1">Unlike <span Class="bold">-4</span> and <span Class="bold">-6</span>, this option doesn't inhibit access to any address family, it only changes the <span Class="emphasis">order</span> in which the addresses are accessed.

This is useful, for instance, when  you're mirroring a remote site that uses <span Class="bold">.asp</span> pages, but you want  the mirrored pages to be viewable on your stock Apache server.  Another  good use for this is when you're downloading CGI-generated materials.  A s-1URL s0 like <span Class="bold">http://site.com/article.cgi?25</span> will be saved as <span Class="emphasis">article.cgi?25.html</span>. 
<p class="level1">Note that filenames changed in this way will be re-downloaded every time you re-mirror a site, because Wget can't tell that the local <span class="emphasis"><span class="emphasis">X<span Class="emphasis">.html</span> file corresponds to remote s-1URL s0<span Class="emphasis">X</span> (since it doesn't yet know that the s-1URLs0 produces output of type <span Class="bold">text/html</span> or <span Class="bold">application/xhtml+xml</span>. 
<p class="level1">As of version 1.12, Wget will also ensure that any downloaded files of type <span Class="bold">text/css</span> end in the suffix <span Class="bold">.css</span>, and the option was renamed from <span Class="bold">--html-extension</span>, to better reflect its new behavior. The old option name is still acceptable, but should now be considered deprecated.

<p class="level1">Another way to specify username and password is in the s-1URLs0 itself.  Either method reveals your password to anyone who bothers to run f(CW*(C`ps*(C'</span>.  To prevent the passwords from being seen, store them in <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span> or <span Class="emphasis">.netrc</span>, and make sure to protect those files from other users with f(CW*(C`chmod*(C'</span>.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Turn off the *(L"keep-alive*(R" feature for s-1HTTPs0 downloads.  Normally, Wget asks the server to keep the connection open so that, when you download more than one document from the same server, they get transferred over the same s-1TCPs0 connection.  This saves time and at the same time reduces the load on the server. 
<p class="level1">This option is useful when, for some reason, persistent (keep-alive) connections don't work for you, for example due to a server bug or due to the inability of server-side scripts to cope with the connections. 
<p class="level0"><a name="fB--no-cachefR"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB--no-cache\fR 4</span> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Disable server-side cache.

<p class="level1">Caching is allowed by default. 
<p class="level0"><a name="fB--no-cookiesfR"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB--no-cookies\fR 4</span> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Disable the use of cookies.  Cookies are a mechanism for maintaining server-side state.  The server sends the client a cookie using the f(CW*(C`Set-Cookie*(C'</span> header, and the client responds with the same cookie upon further requests.  Since cookies allow the server owners to keep track of visitors and for sites to exchange this information, some consider them a breach of privacy.  The default is to use cookies; however, <span Class="emphasis">storing</span> cookies is not on by default. 
<p class="level0"><a name="fB--load-cookiesfR"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB--load-cookies\fR \fIfile\fR 4</span> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Load cookies from <span Class="emphasis">file</span> before the first s-1HTTPs0 retrieval. <span Class="emphasis">file</span> is a textual file in the format originally used by Netscape's <span Class="emphasis">cookies.txt</span> file. 
<p class="level1">You will typically use this option when mirroring sites that require that you be logged in to access some or all of their content.  The login process typically works by the web server issuing an s-1HTTPs0 cookie upon receiving and verifying your credentials.  The cookie is then resent by the browser when accessing that part of the site, and so proves your identity. 
<p class="level1">Mirroring such a site requires Wget to send the same cookies your browser sends when communicating with the site.  This is achieved by <span Class="bold">--load-cookies</span>---simply point Wget to the location of the <span Class="emphasis">cookies.txt</span> file, and it will send the same cookies your browser would send in the same situation.  Different browsers keep textual cookie files in different locations: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">The cookies are in <span Class="emphasis">~/.netscape/cookies.txt</span>. 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">Mozilla's cookie file is also named <span Class="emphasis">cookies.txt</span>, located somewhere under <span Class="emphasis">~/.mozilla</span>, in the directory of your profile. The full path usually ends up looking somewhat like <span class="emphasis">~/.mozilla/default/<span class="emphasis">some-weird-string<span Class="emphasis">/cookies.txt</span>. 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">You can produce a cookie file Wget can use by using the File menu, Import and Export, Export Cookies.  This has been tested with Internet Explorer 5; it is not guaranteed to work with earlier versions. 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">If you are using a different browser to create your cookies, <span Class="bold">--load-cookies</span> will only work if you can locate or produce a cookie file in the Netscape format that Wget expects. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">If you cannot use <span Class="bold">--load-cookies</span>, there might still be an alternative.  If your browser supports a *(L"cookie manager*(R", you can use it to view the cookies used when accessing the site you're mirroring. Write down the name and value of the cookie, and manually instruct Wget to send those cookies, bypassing the *(L"official*(R" cookie support: 
<p class="level2">

<p class="level1">When specified, causes <span Class="bold">--save-cookies</span> to also save session cookies.  Session cookies are normally not saved because they are meant to be kept in memory and forgotten when you exit the browser. Saving them is useful on sites that require you to log in or to visit the home page before you can access some pages.  With this option, multiple Wget runs are considered a single browser session as far as the site is concerned. 
<p class="level1">Since the cookie file format does not normally carry session cookies, Wget marks them with an expiry timestamp of 0.  Wget's <span Class="bold">--load-cookies</span> recognizes those as session cookies, but it might confuse other browsers.  Also note that cookies so loaded will be treated as other session cookies, which means that if you want <span Class="bold">--save-cookies</span> to preserve them again, you must use <span Class="bold">--keep-session-cookies</span> again. 
<p class="level0"><a name="fB--ignore-lengthfR"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB--ignore-length\fR 4</span> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Unfortunately, some s-1HTTPs0 servers (s-1CGIs0 programs, to be more precise) send out bogus f(CW*(C`Content-Length*(C'</span> headers, which makes Wget go wild, as it thinks not all the document was retrieved.  You can spot this syndrome if Wget retries getting the same document again and again, each time claiming that the (otherwise normal) connection has closed on the very same byte. 
<p class="level1">With this option, Wget will ignore the f(CW*(C`Content-Length*(C'</span> header---as if it never existed.

<p class="level1">Specification of an empty string as the header value will clear all previous user-defined headers. 
<p class="level1">As of Wget 1.10, this option can be used to override headers otherwise generated automatically.  This example instructs Wget to connect to localhost, but to specify <span Class="bold">foo.bar</span> in the f(CW*(C`Host*(C'</span> header: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       wget --header="Host: foo.bar" <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>

<p class="level1">In versions of Wget prior to 1.10 such use of <span Class="bold">--header</span> caused sending of duplicate headers.

<p class="level1">Identify as <span Class="emphasis">agent-string</span> to the s-1HTTPs0 server. 
<p class="level1">The s-1HTTPs0 protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a f(CW*(C`User-Agent*(C'</span> header field.  This enables distinguishing the s-1WWWs0 software, usually for statistical purposes or for tracing of protocol violations.  Wget normally identifies as <span Class="bold">Wget/</span><span Class="emphasis">version</span>, <span Class="emphasis">version</span> being the current version number of Wget. 
<p class="level1">However, some sites have been known to impose the policy of tailoring the output according to the f(CW*(C`User-Agent*(C'</span>-supplied information. While this is not such a bad idea in theory, it has been abused by servers denying information to clients other than (historically) Netscape or, more frequently, Microsoft Internet Explorer.  This option allows you to change the f(CW*(C`User-Agent*(C'</span> line issued by Wget. Use of this option is discouraged, unless you really know what you are doing. 
<p class="level1">Specifying empty user agent with <span Class="bold">--user-agent=""</span> instructs Wget not to send the f(CW*(C`User-Agent*(C'</span> header in s-1HTTPs0 requests.

In particular, they <span Class="emphasis">both</span> expect content of the form f(CW*(C`key1=value1&key2=value2*(C'</span>, with percent-encoding for special characters; the only difference is that one expects its content as a command-line parameter and the other accepts its content from a file. In particular, <span Class="bold">--post-file</span> is <span Class="emphasis">not</span> for transmitting files as form attachments: those must appear as f(CW*(C`key=value*(C'</span> data (with appropriate percent-coding) just like everything else. Wget does not currently support f(CW*(C`multipart/form-data*(C'</span> for transmitting s-1POSTs0 data; only f(CW*(C`application/x-www-form-urlencoded*(C'</span>. Only one of <span Class="bold">--post-data</span> and <span Class="bold">--post-file</span> should be specified. 
<p class="level1">Please note that wget does not require the content to be of the form f(CW*(C`key1=value1&key2=value2*(C'</span>, and neither does it test for it. Wget will simply transmit whatever data is provided to it. Most servers however expect the s-1POSTs0 data to be in the above format when processing s-1HTMLs0 Forms. 
<p class="level1">Please be aware that Wget needs to know the size of the s-1POSTs0 data in advance.  Therefore the argument to f(CW*(C`--post-file*(C'</span> must be a regular file; specifying a s-1FIFOs0 or something like <span Class="emphasis">/dev/stdin</span> won't work. It's not quite clear how to work around this limitation inherent in s-1HTTP/1.0. s0 Although s-1HTTP/1.1s0 introduces <span Class="emphasis">chunked</span> transfer that doesn't require knowing the request length in advance, a client can't use chunked unless it knows it's talking to an s-1HTTP/1.1s0 server.  And it can't know that until it receives a response, which in turn requires the request to have been completed *(-- a chicken-and-egg problem. 
<p class="level1">Note: As of version 1.15 if Wget is redirected after the s-1POSTs0 request is completed, its behaviour will depend on the response code returned by the server.  In case of a 301 Moved Permanently, 302 Moved Temporarily or 307 Temporary Redirect, Wget will, in accordance with s-1RFC2616,s0 continue to send a s-1POSTs0 request. In case a server wants the client to change the Request method upon redirection, it should send a 303 See Other response code. 
<p class="level1">This example shows how to log in to a server using s-1POSTs0 and then proceed to download the desired pages, presumably only accessible to authorized users: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       &#35; Log in to the server.  This can be done only once. &nbsp;       wget --save-cookies cookies.txt e &nbsp;            --post-data *(Aquser=foo&password=bar*(Aq e &nbsp;            <a href="http://server.com/auth.php">http://server.com/auth.php</a>

<p class="level1">If the server is using session cookies to track user authentication, the above will not work because <span Class="bold">--save-cookies</span> will not save them (and neither will browsers) and the <span Class="emphasis">cookies.txt</span> file will be empty.

<p class="level1">The <span Class="bold">-r</span> option is to retrieve recursively, and <span Class="bold">-nd</span> to not create directories. 
<p class="level1">Note that <span Class="bold">--delete-after</span> deletes files on the local machine.  It does not issue the <span Class="bold">s-1DELEs0</span> command to remote s-1FTPs0 sites, for instance.  Also note that when <span Class="bold">--delete-after</span> is specified, <span Class="bold">--convert-links</span> is ignored, so <span Class="bold">.orig</span> files are simply not created in the first place.

<p class="level1">After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to make them suitable for local viewing.  This affects not only the visible hyperlinks, but any part of the document that links to external content, such as embedded images, links to style sheets, hyperlinks to non-HTML content, etc. 
<p class="level1">Each link will be changed in one of the two ways: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level1"><a name="bu"></a><span class="nroffip">\(bu 4</span> 
<p class="level2">The links to files that have been downloaded by Wget will be changed to refer to the file they point to as a relative link. 
<p class="level2">Example: if the downloaded file <span Class="emphasis">/foo/doc.html</span> links to <span Class="emphasis">/bar/img.gif</span>, also downloaded, then the link in <span Class="emphasis">doc.html</span> will be modified to point to <span Class="bold">../bar/img.gif</span>.  This kind of transformation works reliably for arbitrary combinations of directories. 
<p class="level1"><a name="bu"></a><span class="nroffip">\(bu 4</span> 
<p class="level2">The links to files that have not been downloaded by Wget will be changed to include host name and absolute path of the location they point to. 
<p class="level2">Example: if the downloaded file <span Class="emphasis">/foo/doc.html</span> links to <span Class="emphasis">/bar/img.gif</span> (or to <span Class="emphasis">../bar/img.gif</span>), then the link in <span Class="emphasis">doc.html</span> will be modified to point to <span class="emphasis">http://<span class="emphasis">hostname<span Class="emphasis">/bar/img.gif</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">Because of this, local browsing works reliably: if a linked file was downloaded, the link will refer to its local name; if it was not downloaded, the link will refer to its full Internet address rather than presenting a broken link.  The fact that the former links are converted to relative links ensures that you can move the downloaded hierarchy to another directory. 
<p class="level2">Note that only at the end of the download can Wget know which links have been downloaded.  Because of that, the work done by <span Class="bold">-k</span> will be performed at the end of all the downloads.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">This option causes Wget to download all the files that are necessary to properly display a given s-1HTMLs0 page.  This includes such things as inlined images, sounds, and referenced stylesheets. 
<p class="level1">Ordinarily, when downloading a single s-1HTMLs0 page, any requisite documents that may be needed to display it properly are not downloaded.  Using <span Class="bold">-r</span> together with <span Class="bold">-l</span> can help, but since Wget does not ordinarily distinguish between external and inlined documents, one is generally left with *(L"leaf documents*(R" that are missing their requisites. 
<p class="level1">For instance, say document <span Class="emphasis">1.html</span> contains an f(CW*(C`&lt;IMG&gt;*(C'</span> tag referencing <span Class="emphasis">1.gif</span> and an f(CW*(C`&lt;A&gt;*(C'</span> tag pointing to external document <span Class="emphasis">2.html</span>.  Say that <span Class="emphasis">2.html</span> is similar but that its image is <span Class="emphasis">2.gif</span> and it links to <span Class="emphasis">3.html</span>.  Say this continues up to some arbitrarily high number. 
<p class="level1">If one executes the command: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       wget -r -l 2 <a href="http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">then <span Class="emphasis">1.html</span>, <span Class="emphasis">1.gif</span>, <span Class="emphasis">2.html</span>, <span Class="emphasis">2.gif</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">3.html</span> will be downloaded.  As you can see, <span Class="emphasis">3.html</span> is without its requisite <span Class="emphasis">3.gif</span> because Wget is simply counting the number of hops (up to 2) away from <span Class="emphasis">1.html</span> in order to determine where to stop the recursion.  However, with this command: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       wget -r -l 2 -p <a href="http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">all the above files <span Class="emphasis">and</span> <span Class="emphasis">3.html</span>'s requisite <span Class="emphasis">3.gif</span> will be downloaded.  Similarly, 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       wget -r -l 1 -p <a href="http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">will cause <span Class="emphasis">1.html</span>, <span Class="emphasis">1.gif</span>, <span Class="emphasis">2.html</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">2.gif</span> to be downloaded.  One might think that: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       wget -r -l 0 -p <a href="http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">would download just <span Class="emphasis">1.html</span> and <span Class="emphasis">1.gif</span>, but unfortunately this is not the case, because <span Class="bold">-l 0</span> is equivalent to <span Class="bold">-l inf</span>---that is, infinite recursion.  To download a single s-1HTMLs0 page (or a handful of them, all specified on the command-line or in a <span Class="bold">-i</span> s-1URLs0 input file) and its (or their) requisites, simply leave off <span Class="bold">-r</span> and <span Class="bold">-l</span>: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       wget -p <a href="http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html">http://&lt;site&gt;/1.html</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Note that Wget will behave as if <span Class="bold">-r</span> had been specified, but only that single page and its requisites will be downloaded.  Links from that page to external documents will not be followed.  Actually, to download a single page and all its requisites (even if they exist on separate websites), and make sure the lot displays properly locally, this author likes to use a few options in addition to <span Class="bold">-p</span>: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp;       wget -E -H -k -K -p <a href="http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;">http://&lt;site&gt;/&lt;document&gt;</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">To finish off this topic, it's worth knowing that Wget's idea of an external document link is any s-1URLs0 specified in an f(CW*(C`&lt;A&gt;*(C'</span> tag, an f(CW*(C`&lt;AREA&gt;*(C'</span> tag, or a f(CW*(C`&lt;LINK&gt;*(C'</span> tag other than f(CW*(C`&lt;LINK REL="stylesheet"&gt;*(C'</span>. 
<p class="level0"><a name="fB--strict-commentsfR"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB--strict-comments\fR 4</span> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Turn on strict parsing of s-1HTMLs0 comments.  The default is to terminate comments at the first occurrence of <span Class="bold">--&gt;</span>. 
<p class="level1">According to specifications, s-1HTMLs0 comments are expressed as s-1SGML s0<span Class="emphasis">declarations</span>.  Declaration is special markup that begins with <span Class="bold">&lt;!</span> and ends with <span Class="bold">&gt;</span>, such as <span Class="bold">&lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;</span>, that may contain comments between a pair of <span Class="bold">--</span> delimiters.  s-1HTMLs0 comments are *(L"empty declarations*(R", s-1SGMLs0 declarations without any non-comment text.  Therefore, <span Class="bold">&lt;!--foo--&gt;</span> is a valid comment, and so is <span Class="bold">&lt;!--one*(-- --two--&gt;</span>, but <span Class="bold">&lt;!--1--2--&gt;</span> is not. 
<p class="level1">On the other hand, most s-1HTMLs0 writers don't perceive comments as anything other than text delimited with <span Class="bold">&lt;!--</span> and <span Class="bold">--&gt;</span>, which is not quite the same.  For example, something like <span Class="bold">&lt;!------------&gt;</span> works as a valid comment as long as the number of dashes is a multiple of four (!).  If not, the comment technically lasts until the next <span Class="bold">--</span>, which may be at the other end of the document.  Because of this, many popular browsers completely ignore the specification and implement what users have come to expect: comments delimited with <span Class="bold">&lt;!--</span> and <span Class="bold">--&gt;</span>. 
<p class="level1">Until version 1.9, Wget interpreted comments strictly, which resulted in missing links in many web pages that displayed fine in browsers, but had the misfortune of containing non-compliant comments.  Beginning with version 1.9, Wget has joined the ranks of clients that implements *(L"naive*(R" comments, terminating each comment at the first occurrence of <span Class="bold">--&gt;</span>.

<p class="level0">Before actually submitting a bug report, please try to follow a few simple guidelines. 
<p class="level0"><a name="1"></a><span class="nroffip">1. 4</span> 
<p class="level1">Please try to ascertain that the behavior you see really is a bug.  If Wget crashes, it's a bug.  If Wget does not behave as documented, it's a bug.  If things work strange, but you are not sure about the way they are supposed to work, it might well be a bug, but you might want to double-check the documentation and the mailing lists. 
<p class="level0"><a name="2"></a><span class="nroffip">2. 4</span> 
<p class="level1">Try to repeat the bug in as simple circumstances as possible.  E.g. if Wget crashes while downloading <span class="bold">wget -rl0 -kKE -t5 --no-proxy <a href="http://yoyodyne.com">http://yoyodyne.com</a> -o /tmp/log</span>, you should try to see if the crash is repeatable, and if will occur with a simpler set of options.  You might even try to start the download at the page where the crash occurred to see if that page somehow triggered the crash. 
<p class="level1">Also, while I will probably be interested to know the contents of your <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span> file, just dumping it into the debug message is probably a bad idea.  Instead, you should first try to see if the bug repeats with <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span> moved out of the way.  Only if it turns out that <span Class="emphasis">.wgetrc</span> settings affect the bug, mail me the relevant parts of the file. 
<p class="level0"><a name="3"></a><span class="nroffip">3. 4</span> 
<p class="level1">Please start Wget with <span Class="bold">-d</span> option and send us the resulting output (or relevant parts thereof).  If Wget was compiled without debug support, recompile it---it is <span Class="emphasis">much</span> easier to trace bugs with debug support on. 
<p class="level1">Note: please make sure to remove any potentially sensitive information from the debug log before sending it to the bug address.  The f(CW*(C`-d*(C'</span> won't go out of its way to collect sensitive information, but the log <span Class="emphasis">will</span> contain a fairly complete transcript of Wget's communication with the server, which may include passwords and pieces of downloaded data.  Since the bug address is publically archived, you may assume that all bug reports are visible to the public.

<p class="level1">If Wget has crashed, try to run it in a debugger, e.g. f(CW*(C`gdb `which wget` core*(C'</span> and type f(CW*(C`where*(C'</span> to get the backtrace.  This may not work if the system administrator has disabled core files, but it is safe to try. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
