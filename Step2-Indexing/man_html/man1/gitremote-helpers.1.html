<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Remote helper programs are normally not used directly by end users, but they are invoked by Git when it needs to interact with remote repositories Git does not support natively. A given helper will implement a subset of the capabilities documented here. When Git needs to interact with a repository using a remote helper, it spawns the helper as an independent process, sends commands to the helper(cqs standard input, and expects results from the helper(cqs standard output. Because a remote helper runs as an independent process from Git, there is no need to re-link Git to add a new helper, nor any need to link the helper with the implementation of Git. 
<p class="level0">Every helper must support the "capabilities" command, which Git uses to determine what other commands the helper will accept. Those other commands can be used to discover and update remote refs, transport objects between the object database and the remote repository, and update the local object store. 
<p class="level0">Git comes with a "curl" family of remote helpers, that handle various transport protocols, such as <span Class="emphasis">git-remote-http</span>, <span Class="emphasis">git-remote-https</span>, <span Class="emphasis">git-remote-ftp</span> and <span Class="emphasis">git-remote-ftps</span>. They implement the capabilities <span Class="emphasis">fetch</span>, <span Class="emphasis">option</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">push</span>. <a name="INVOCATION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">INVOCATION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Remote helper programs are invoked with one or (optionally) two arguments. The first argument specifies a remote repository as in Git; it is either the name of a configured remote or a URL. The second argument specifies a URL; it is usually of the form <span Class="emphasis">&lt;transport&gt;://&lt;address&gt;</span>, but any arbitrary string is possible. The <span Class="emphasis">GIT_DIR</span> environment variable is set up for the remote helper and can be used to determine where to store additional data or from which directory to invoke auxiliary Git commands. 
<p class="level0">When Git encounters a URL of the form <span Class="emphasis">&lt;transport&gt;://&lt;address&gt;</span>, where <span Class="emphasis">&lt;transport&gt;</span> is a protocol that it cannot handle natively, it automatically invokes <span Class="emphasis">git remote-&lt;transport&gt;</span> with the full URL as the second argument. If such a URL is encountered directly on the command line, the first argument is the same as the second, and if it is encountered in a configured remote, the first argument is the name of that remote. 
<p class="level0">A URL of the form <span Class="emphasis">&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</span> explicitly instructs Git to invoke <span Class="emphasis">git remote-&lt;transport&gt;</span> with <span Class="emphasis">&lt;address&gt;</span> as the second argument. If such a URL is encountered directly on the command line, the first argument is <span Class="emphasis">&lt;address&gt;</span>, and if it is encountered in a configured remote, the first argument is the name of that remote. 
<p class="level0">Additionally, when a configured remote has <span Class="emphasis">remote.&lt;name&gt;.vcs</span> set to <span Class="emphasis">&lt;transport&gt;</span>, Git explicitly invokes <span Class="emphasis">git remote-&lt;transport&gt;</span> with <span Class="emphasis">&lt;name&gt;</span> as the first argument. If set, the second argument is <span Class="emphasis">remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</span>; otherwise, the second argument is omitted. <a name="INPUT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">INPUT FORMAT</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Git sends the remote helper a list of commands on standard input, one per line. The first command is always the <span Class="emphasis">capabilities</span> command, in response to which the remote helper must print a list of the capabilities it supports (see below) followed by a blank line. The response to the capabilities command determines what commands Git uses in the remainder of the command stream. 
<p class="level0">The command stream is terminated by a blank line. In some cases (indicated in the documentation of the relevant commands), this blank line is followed by a payload in some other protocol (e.g., the pack protocol), while in others it indicates the end of input. <a name="Capabilities"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Capabilities</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Each remote helper is expected to support only a subset of commands. The operations a helper supports are declared to Git in the response to the capabilities command (see COMMANDS, below). 
<p class="level0">In the following, we list all defined capabilities and for each we list which commands a helper with that capability must provide. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><br>
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#Capabilities">Capabilities for Pushing</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">connect</span> 
<p class="level2">Can attempt to connect to <span Class="emphasis">git receive-pack</span> (for pushing), <span Class="emphasis">git upload-pack</span>, etc for communication using git(cqs native packfile protocol. This requires a bidirectional, full-duplex connection. 
<p class="level2">Supported commands: <span Class="emphasis">connect</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">push</span> 
<p class="level2">Can discover remote refs and push local commits and the history leading up to them to new or existing remote refs. 
<p class="level2">Supported commands: <span Class="emphasis">list for-push</span>, <span Class="emphasis">push</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">export</span> 
<p class="level2">Can discover remote refs and push specified objects from a fast-import stream to remote refs. 
<p class="level2">Supported commands: <span Class="emphasis">list for-push</span>, <span Class="emphasis">export</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">If a helper advertises <span Class="emphasis">connect</span>, Git will use it if possible and fall back to another capability if the helper requests so when connecting (see the <span Class="emphasis">connect</span> command under COMMANDS). When choosing between <span Class="emphasis">push</span> and <span Class="emphasis">export</span>, Git prefers <span Class="emphasis">push</span>. Other frontends may have some other order of preference. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">no-private-update</span> 
<p class="level2">When using the <span Class="emphasis">refspec</span> capability, git normally updates the private ref on successful push. This update is disabled when the remote-helper declares the capability <span Class="emphasis">no-private-update</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><br>
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#Capabilities">Capabilities for Fetching</a> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">connect</span> 
<p class="level2">Can try to connect to <span Class="emphasis">git upload-pack</span> (for fetching), <span Class="emphasis">git receive-pack</span>, etc for communication using the Git(cqs native packfile protocol. This requires a bidirectional, full-duplex connection. 
<p class="level2">Supported commands: <span Class="emphasis">connect</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">fetch</span> 
<p class="level2">Can discover remote refs and transfer objects reachable from them to the local object store. 
<p class="level2">Supported commands: <span Class="emphasis">list</span>, <span Class="emphasis">fetch</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">import</span> 
<p class="level2">Can discover remote refs and output objects reachable from them as a stream in fast-import format. 
<p class="level2">Supported commands: <span Class="emphasis">list</span>, <span Class="emphasis">import</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">check-connectivity</span> 
<p class="level2">Can guarantee that when a clone is requested, the received pack is self contained and is connected. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">If a helper advertises <span Class="emphasis">connect</span>, Git will use it if possible and fall back to another capability if the helper requests so when connecting (see the <span Class="emphasis">connect</span> command under COMMANDS). When choosing between <span Class="emphasis">fetch</span> and <span Class="emphasis">import</span>, Git prefers <span Class="emphasis">fetch</span>. Other frontends may have some other order of preference. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><br>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Miscellaneous capabilities</span> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">option</span> 
<p class="level2">For specifying settings like verbosity (how much output to write to stderr) and depth (how much history is wanted in the case of a shallow clone) that affect how other commands are carried out. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">refspec</span> &lt;refspec&gt; 
<p class="level2">For remote helpers that implement <span Class="emphasis">import</span> or <span Class="emphasis">export</span>, this capability allows the refs to be constrained to a private namespace, instead of writing to refs/heads or refs/remotes directly. It is recommended that all importers providing the <span Class="emphasis">import</span> capability use this. It(cqs mandatory for <span Class="emphasis">export</span>. 
<p class="level2">A helper advertising the capability refspec refs/heads/*:refs/svn/origin/branches/* is saying that, when it is asked to import refs/heads/topic, the stream it outputs will update the refs/svn/origin/branches/topic ref. 
<p class="level2">This capability can be advertised multiple times. The first applicable refspec takes precedence. The left-hand of refspecs advertised with this capability must cover all refs reported by the list command. If no <span Class="emphasis">refspec</span> capability is advertised, there is an implied refspec *:*. 
<p class="level2">When writing remote-helpers for decentralized version control systems, it is advised to keep a local copy of the repository to interact with, and to let the private namespace refs point to this local repository, while the refs/remotes namespace is used to track the remote repository. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">bidi-import</span> 
<p class="level2">This modifies the <span Class="emphasis">import</span> capability. The fast-import commands <span Class="emphasis">cat-blob</span> and <span Class="emphasis">ls</span> can be used by remote-helpers to retrieve information about blobs and trees that already exist in fast-import(cqs memory. This requires a channel from fast-import to the remote-helper. If it is advertised in addition to "import", Git establishes a pipe from fast-import to the remote-helper(cqs stdin. It follows that Git and fast-import are both connected to the remote-helper(cqs stdin. Because Git can send multiple commands to the remote-helper it is required that helpers that use <span Class="emphasis">bidi-import</span> buffer all <span Class="emphasis">import</span> commands of a batch before sending data to fast-import. This is to prevent mixing commands and fast-import responses on the helper(cqs stdin. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">export-marks</span> &lt;file&gt; 
<p class="level2">This modifies the <span Class="emphasis">export</span> capability, instructing Git to dump the internal marks table to &lt;file&gt; when complete. For details, read up on <span Class="emphasis">--export-marks=&lt;file&gt;</span> in <span Class="bold">git-fast-export</span>(1). 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">import-marks</span> &lt;file&gt; 
<p class="level2">This modifies the <span Class="emphasis">export</span> capability, instructing Git to load the marks specified in &lt;file&gt; before processing any input. For details, read up on <span Class="emphasis">--import-marks=&lt;file&gt;</span> in <span Class="bold">git-fast-export</span>(1). 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">signed-tags</span> 
<p class="level2">This modifies the <span Class="emphasis">export</span> capability, instructing Git to pass <span Class="emphasis">--signed-tags=verbatim</span> to <span Class="bold">git-fast-export</span>(1). In the absence of this capability, Git will use <span Class="emphasis">--signed-tags=warn-strip</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="COMMANDS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMMANDS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Commands are given by the caller on the helper(cqs standard input, one per line. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">capabilities</span> 
<p class="level1">Lists the capabilities of the helper, one per line, ending with a blank line. Each capability may be preceded with <span Class="emphasis">*</span>, which marks them mandatory for Git versions using the remote helper to understand. Any unknown mandatory capability is a fatal error. 
<p class="level1">Support for this command is mandatory. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">list</span> 
<p class="level1">Lists the refs, one per line, in the format "&lt;value&gt; &lt;name&gt; [&lt;attr&gt; ...]". The value may be a hex sha1 hash, "@&lt;dest&gt;" for a symref, or "?" to indicate that the helper could not get the value of the ref. A space-separated list of attributes follows the name; unrecognized attributes are ignored. The list ends with a blank line. 
<p class="level1">See REF LIST ATTRIBUTES for a list of currently defined attributes. 
<p class="level1">Supported if the helper has the "fetch" or "import" capability. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">list for-push</span> 
<p class="level1">Similar to <span Class="emphasis">list</span>, except that it is used if and only if the caller wants to the resulting ref list to prepare push commands. A helper supporting both push and fetch can use this to distinguish for which operation the output of <span Class="emphasis">list</span> is going to be used, possibly reducing the amount of work that needs to be performed. 
<p class="level1">Supported if the helper has the "push" or "export" capability. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option</span> &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt; 
<p class="level1">Sets the transport helper option &lt;name&gt; to &lt;value&gt;. Outputs a single line containing one of <span Class="emphasis">ok</span> (option successfully set), <span Class="emphasis">unsupported</span> (option not recognized) or <span Class="emphasis">error &lt;msg&gt;</span> (option &lt;name&gt; is supported but &lt;value&gt; is not valid for it). Options should be set before other commands, and may influence the behavior of those commands. 
<p class="level1">See OPTIONS for a list of currently defined options. 
<p class="level1">Supported if the helper has the "option" capability. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">fetch</span> &lt;sha1&gt; &lt;name&gt; 
<p class="level1">Fetches the given object, writing the necessary objects to the database. Fetch commands are sent in a batch, one per line, terminated with a blank line. Outputs a single blank line when all fetch commands in the same batch are complete. Only objects which were reported in the output of <span Class="emphasis">list</span> with a sha1 may be fetched this way. 
<p class="level1">Optionally may output a <span Class="emphasis">lock &lt;file&gt;</span> line indicating a file under GIT_DIR/objects/pack which is keeping a pack until refs can be suitably updated. 
<p class="level1">If option <span Class="emphasis">check-connectivity</span> is requested, the helper must output <span Class="emphasis">connectivity-ok</span> if the clone is self-contained and connected. 
<p class="level1">Supported if the helper has the "fetch" capability. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">push</span> +&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt; 
<p class="level1">Pushes the given local &lt;src&gt; commit or branch to the remote branch described by &lt;dst&gt;. A batch sequence of one or more <span Class="emphasis">push</span> commands is terminated with a blank line (if there is only one reference to push, a single <span Class="emphasis">push</span> command is followed by a blank line). For example, the following would be two batches of <span Class="emphasis">push</span>, the first asking the remote-helper to push the local ref <span Class="emphasis">master</span> to the remote ref <span Class="emphasis">master</span> and the local <span Class="emphasis">HEAD</span> to the remote <span Class="emphasis">branch</span>, and the second asking to push ref <span Class="emphasis">foo</span> to ref <span Class="emphasis">bar</span> (forced update requested by the <span Class="emphasis">+</span>). 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2"><pre class="level2">
push refs/heads/master:refs/heads/master
push HEAD:refs/heads/branch
en
push +refs/heads/foo:refs/heads/bar
en
</pre>

<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Zero or more protocol options may be entered after the last <span Class="emphasis">push</span> command, before the batch(cqs terminating blank line. 
<p class="level1">When the push is complete, outputs one or more <span Class="emphasis">ok &lt;dst&gt;</span> or <span Class="emphasis">error &lt;dst&gt; &lt;why&gt;?</span> lines to indicate success or failure of each pushed ref. The status report output is terminated by a blank line. The option field &lt;why&gt; may be quoted in a C style string if it contains an LF. 
<p class="level1">Supported if the helper has the "push" capability. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">import</span> &lt;name&gt; 
<p class="level1">Produces a fast-import stream which imports the current value of the named ref. It may additionally import other refs as needed to construct the history efficiently. The script writes to a helper-specific private namespace. The value of the named ref should be written to a location in this namespace derived by applying the refspecs from the "refspec" capability to the name of the ref. 
<p class="level1">Especially useful for interoperability with a foreign versioning system. 
<p class="level1">Just like <span Class="emphasis">push</span>, a batch sequence of one or more <span Class="emphasis">import</span> is terminated with a blank line. For each batch of <span Class="emphasis">import</span>, the remote helper should produce a fast-import stream terminated by a <span Class="emphasis">done</span> command. 
<p class="level1">Note that if the <span Class="emphasis">bidi-import</span> capability is used the complete batch sequence has to be buffered before starting to send data to fast-import to prevent mixing of commands and fast-import responses on the helper(cqs stdin. 
<p class="level1">Supported if the helper has the "import" capability. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">export</span> 
<p class="level1">Instructs the remote helper that any subsequent input is part of a fast-import stream (generated by <span Class="emphasis">git fast-export</span>) containing objects which should be pushed to the remote. 
<p class="level1">Especially useful for interoperability with a foreign versioning system. 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="emphasis">export-marks</span> and <span Class="emphasis">import-marks</span> capabilities, if specified, affect this command in so far as they are passed on to <span Class="emphasis">git fast-export</span>, which then will load/store a table of marks for local objects. This can be used to implement for incremental operations. 
<p class="level1">Supported if the helper has the "export" capability. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">connect</span> &lt;service&gt; 
<p class="level1">Connects to given service. Standard input and standard output of helper are connected to specified service (git prefix is included in service name so e.g. fetching uses <span Class="emphasis">git-upload-pack</span> as service) on remote side. Valid replies to this command are empty line (connection established), <span Class="emphasis">fallback</span> (no smart transport support, fall back to dumb transports) and just exiting with error message printed (can(cqt connect, don(cqt bother trying to fall back). After line feed terminating the positive (empty) response, the output of service starts. After the connection ends, the remote helper exits. 
<p class="level1">Supported if the helper has the "connect" capability. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If a fatal error occurs, the program writes the error message to stderr and exits. The caller should expect that a suitable error message has been printed if the child closes the connection without completing a valid response for the current command. 
<p class="level0">Additional commands may be supported, as may be determined from capabilities reported by the helper. <a name="REF"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">REF LIST ATTRIBUTES</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">list</span> command produces a list of refs in which each ref may be followed by a list of attributes. The following ref list attributes are defined. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">unchanged</span> 
<p class="level1">This ref is unchanged since the last import or fetch, although the helper cannot necessarily determine what value that produced. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The following options are defined and (under suitable circumstances) set by Git if the remote helper has the <span Class="emphasis">option</span> capability. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option verbosity</span> &lt;n&gt; 
<p class="level1">Changes the verbosity of messages displayed by the helper. A value of 0 for &lt;n&gt; means that processes operate quietly, and the helper produces only error output. 1 is the default level of verbosity, and higher values of &lt;n&gt; correspond to the number of -v flags passed on the command line. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option progress</span> {<span Class="emphasis">true</span>|<span Class="emphasis">false</span>} 
<p class="level1">Enables (or disables) progress messages displayed by the transport helper during a command. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option depth</span> &lt;depth&gt; 
<p class="level1">Deepens the history of a shallow repository. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option followtags</span> {<span Class="emphasis">true</span>|<span Class="emphasis">false</span>} 
<p class="level1">If enabled the helper should automatically fetch annotated tag objects if the object the tag points at was transferred during the fetch command. If the tag is not fetched by the helper a second fetch command will usually be sent to ask for the tag specifically. Some helpers may be able to use this option to avoid a second network connection. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option dry-run</span> {<span Class="emphasis">true</span>|<span Class="emphasis">false</span>}: If true, pretend the operation completed successfully, but don(cqt actually change any repository data. For most helpers this only applies to the <span Class="emphasis">push</span>, if supported. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option servpath &lt;c-style-quoted-path&gt;</span> 
<p class="level1">Sets service path (--upload-pack, --receive-pack etc.) for next connect. Remote helper may support this option, but must not rely on this option being set before connect request occurs. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option check-connectivity</span> {<span Class="emphasis">true</span>|<span Class="emphasis">false</span>} 
<p class="level1">Request the helper to check connectivity of a clone. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option force</span> {<span Class="emphasis">true</span>|<span Class="emphasis">false</span>} 
<p class="level1">Request the helper to perform a force update. Defaults to <span Class="emphasis">false</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option cloning {*(Aqtrue</span>|<span Class="emphasis">false</span>} 
<p class="level1">Notify the helper this is a clone request (i.e. the current repository is guaranteed empty). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">option update-shallow {*(Aqtrue</span>|<span Class="emphasis">false</span>} 
<p class="level1">Allow to extend .git/shallow if the new refs require it.
