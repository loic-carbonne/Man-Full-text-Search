<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This command is very raw and is therefore only partially implemented;  we present it here as a rough prototype for developers, not as a general purpose tool for end users.  Something like this might make a suitable replacement for xev;  I'm not signing up, mind you, but it's an interesting idea. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">xkbevd</span> event daemon listens for specified XKB events and executes requested commands if they occur.   The configuration file consists of a list of event specification/action pairs and/or variable definitions. 
<p class="level0">An event specification consists of a short XKB event name followed by a string or identifier which serves as a qualifier in parentheses;  empty parenthesis indicate no qualification and serve to specify the default command which is applied to events which do not match any of the other specifications.  The interpretation of the qualifier depends on the type of the event:  Bell events match using the name of the bell, message events match on the contents of the message string and slow key events accept any of <span Class="emphasis">press</span>, <span Class="emphasis">release</span>, <span Class="emphasis">accept</span>, or <span Class="emphasis">reject</span>.   No other events are currently recognized. 
<p class="level0">An action consists of an optional keyword followed by an optional string argument.  Currently, <span Class="emphasis">xkbev</span> recognizes the actions: <span Class="emphasis">none</span>, <span Class="emphasis">ignore</span>, <span Class="emphasis">echo</span>, <span Class="emphasis">printEvent</span>, <span Class="emphasis">sound</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">shell</span>. If the action is not specified, the string is taken as the name of a sound file to be played unless it begins with an exclamation point, in which case it is taken as a shell command. 
<p class="level0">Variable definitions in the argument string are expanded with fields from the event in question before the argument string is passed to the action processor.   The general syntax for a variable is either $<span class="emphasis">cP or $(<span Class="emphasis">str</span>), where <span Class="emphasis">c</span> is a single character and <span Class="emphasis">str</span> is a string of arbitrary length.  All parameters have both single-character and long names. 
<p class="level0">The list of recognized parameters varies from event to event and is too long to list here right now.   This is a developer release anyway, so you can be expected to look at the source code (evargs.c is of particular interest). 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">ignore</span>, <span Class="emphasis">echo</span>, <span Class="emphasis">printEvent</span>, <span Class="emphasis">sound</span>,and <span Class="emphasis">shell</span> actions do what you would expect commands named <span Class="emphasis">ignore</span>, <span Class="emphasis">echo</span>, <span Class="emphasis">printEvent</span>, <span Class="emphasis">sound</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">shell</span> to do, except that the sound command has only been implemented and tested for SGI machines.   It launches an external program right now, so it should be pretty easy to adapt, especially if you like audio cues that arrive about a half-second after you expect them. 
<p class="level0">The only currently recognized variables are <span Class="emphasis">soundDirectory</span> and <span Class="emphasis">soundCmd</span>.  I'm sure you can figure out what they do. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-help</span> Prints a usage message that is far more up-to-date than anything in this man page. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-cfg file</span> Specifies the configuration file to read.   If no configuration file is specified, <span Class="emphasis">xkbevd</span> looks for ~/.xkb/xkbevd.cf and $(LIBDIR)/xkb/xkbevd.cf in that order. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-sc\ cmd</span> Specifies the command used to play sounds. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-sd\ directory</span> Specifies a top-level directory for sound files. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-display\ display</span> Specifies the display to use.  If not present, <span Class="emphasis">xkbevd</span> uses $DISPLAY. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-bg</span> Tells <span Class="emphasis">xkbevd</span> to fork itself (and run in the background). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-synch</span> Forces synchronization of all X requests.  Slow. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Print more information, including debugging messages.   Multiple specifications of <span Class="emphasis">-v</span> cause more output, to a point. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
