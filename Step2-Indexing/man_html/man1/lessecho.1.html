<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">lessecho</span> is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard output. But any metacharacter in the output is preceded by an "escape" character, which by default is a backslash. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">A summary of options is included below. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ex</span> Specifies "x", rather than backslash, to be the escape char for metachars. If x is "-", no escape char is used and arguments containing metachars are surrounded by quotes instead. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ox</span> Specifies "x", rather than double-quote, to be the open quote character, which is used if the -e- option is specified. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-cx</span> Specifies "x" to be the close quote character. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-pn</span> Specifies "n" to be the open quote character, as an integer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-dn</span> Specifies "n" to be the close quote character, as an integer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-mx</span> Specifies "x" to be a metachar. By default, no characters are considered metachars. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-nn</span> Specifies "n" to be a metachar, as an integer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-fn</span> Specifies "n" to be the escape char for metachars, as an integer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-a</span> Specifies that all arguments are to be quoted. The default is that only arguments containing metacharacters are quoted <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
