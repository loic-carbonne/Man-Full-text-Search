<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xorg</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">... ]</span> <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xorg</span> is a full featured X server that was originally designed for UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems running on Intel x86 hardware.  It now runs on a wider range of hardware and OS platforms. 
<p class="level0">This work was derived by the X.Org Foundation from the XFree86 Project's <span Class="emphasis">XFree86\ 4.4rc2</span> release. The XFree86 release was originally derived from <span Class="emphasis">X386\ 1.2</span> by Thomas Roell which was contributed to X11R5 by Snitily Graphics Consulting Service. <a name="PLATFORMS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PLATFORMS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xorg</span> operates under a wide range of operating systems and hardware platforms. The Intel x86 (IA32) architecture is the most widely supported hardware platform.  Other hardware platforms include Compaq Alpha, Intel IA64, AMD64, SPARC and PowerPC.  The most widely supported operating systems are the free/OpenSource UNIX-like systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris.  Commercial UNIX operating systems such as UnixWare are also supported.  Other supported operating systems include GNU Hurd.  Mac OS X is supported with the Xquartz(1) X server.  Win32/Cygwin is supported with the XWin(1) X server. 
<p class="level0"><a name="NETWORK"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">NETWORK CONNECTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xorg</span> supports connections made using the following reliable byte-streams: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Local</span> On most platforms, the "Local" connection type is a UNIX-domain socket. On some System V platforms, the "local" connection types also include STREAMS pipes, named pipes, and some other mechanisms. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">TCP\/IP</span> <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> listens on port 
<p class="level0">where <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is the display number.  This connection type can be disabled with the <span Class="bold">-nolisten</span> option (see the Xserver(1) man page for details). <a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
<p class="level0">For operating systems that support local connections other than Unix Domain sockets (SVR3 and SVR4), there is a compiled-in list specifying the order in which local connections should be attempted.  This list can be overridden by the <span Class="emphasis">XLOCAL</span> environment variable described below.  If the display name indicates a best-choice connection should be made (e.g. <span Class="manpage">:0.0 )</span>each connection mechanism is tried until a connection succeeds or no more mechanisms are available.  Note: for these OSs, the Unix Domain socket connection is treated differently from the other local connection types.  To use it the connection must be made to <span Class="manpage">unix:0.0 .</span>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">XLOCAL</span> environment variable should contain a list of one more more of the following: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
NAMED
PTS
SCO
ISC
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">which represent SVR4 Named Streams pipe, Old-style USL Streams pipe, SCO XSight Streams pipe, and ISC Streams pipe, respectively.  You can select a single mechanism (e.g. <span Class="emphasis">XLOCAL=NAMED ),</span> or an ordered list (e.g. <span Class="emphasis">XLOCAL="NAMED:PTS:SCO"</span>). his variable overrides the compiled-in defaults.  For SVR4 it is recommended that <span Class="emphasis">NAMED</span> be the first preference connection.  The default setting is <span Class="emphasis">PTS:NAMED:ISC:SCO .</span> 
<p class="level0">To globally override the compiled-in defaults, you should define (and export if using <span Class="bold">sh</span> or <span Class="manpage">ksh )</span><span Class="emphasis">XLOCAL</span> globally.  If you use startx(1) or xinit(1), the definition should be at the top of your <span Class="emphasis">.xinitrc</span> file.  If you use xdm(1), the definitions should be early on in the <span Class="emphasis">/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession</span> script. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xorg</span> supports several mechanisms for supplying/obtaining configuration and run-time parameters: command line options, environment variables, the xorg.conf(5) configuration files, auto-detection, and fallback defaults.  When the same information is supplied in more than one way, the highest precedence mechanism is used.  The list of mechanisms is ordered from highest precedence to lowest.  Note that not all parameters can be supplied via all methods.  The available command line options and environment variables (and some defaults) are described here and in the Xserver(1) manual page.  Most configuration file parameters, with their defaults, are described in the xorg.conf(5) manual page.  Driver and module specific configuration parameters are described in the relevant driver or module manual page. 
<p class="level0">In addition to the normal server options described in the Xserver(1) manual page, <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> accepts the following command line switches: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">vt XX</span> <span Class="emphasis">XX</span> specifies the Virtual Terminal device number which <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> will use.  Without this option, <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> will pick the first available Virtual Terminal that it can locate.  This option applies only to platforms that have virtual terminal support, such as Linux, BSD, OpenSolaris, SVR3, and SVR4. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-allowMouseOpenFail</span> Allow the server to start up even if the mouse device can't be opened or initialised.  This is equivalent to the <span Class="bold">AllowMouseOpenFail</span> xorg.conf(5) file option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-allowNonLocalXvidtune</span> Make the VidMode extension available to remote clients.  This allows the xvidtune client to connect from another host.  This is equivalent to the <span Class="bold">AllowNonLocalXvidtune</span> xorg.conf(5) file option.  By default non-local connections are not allowed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-bgamma  value</span> Set the blue gamma correction. <span Class="emphasis">value</span> must be between 0.1 and 10. The default is 1.0.  Not all drivers support this.  See also the , <span Class="manpage">-gamma</span>, <span Class="manpage">-rgamma</span>and <span Class="bold">-ggamma</span> options. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-bpp  n</span> No longer supported.  Use <span Class="bold">-depth</span> to set the color depth, and use <span Class="bold">-fbbpp</span> if you really need to force a non-default framebuffer (hardware) pixel format. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-config  file</span> Read the server configuration from <span Class="emphasis">file .</span> This option will work for any file when the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid 0), or for files relative to a directory in the config search path for all other users. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-configdir  directory</span> Read the server configuration files from <span Class="emphasis">directory .</span> This option will work for any directory when the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid 0), or for directories relative to a directory in the config directory search path for all other users. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-configure</span> When this option is specified, the <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server loads all video driver modules, probes for available hardware, and writes out an initial xorg.conf(5) file based on what was detected.  This option currently has some problems on some platforms, but in most cases it is a good way to bootstrap the configuration process.  This option is only available when the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid 0). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-crt /dev/tty XX</span> SCO only.  This is the same as the <span Class="bold">vt</span> option, and is provided for compatibility with the native SCO X server. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-depth  n</span> Sets the default color depth.  Legal values are 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, and 24.  Not all drivers support all values. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-disableVidMode</span> Disable the parts of the VidMode extension (used by the xvidtune client) that can be used to change the video modes.  This is equivalent to the <span Class="bold">DisableVidModeExtension</span> xorg.conf(5) file option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-fbbpp n</span> Sets the number of framebuffer bits per pixel.  You should only set this if you're sure it's necessary; normally the server can deduce the correct value from <span Class="bold">-depth</span> above.  Useful if you want to run a depth 24 configuration with a 24 bpp framebuffer rather than the (possibly default) 32 bpp framebuffer (or vice versa).  Legal values are 1, 8, 16, 24, 32.  Not all drivers support all values. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-flipPixels</span> Swap the default values for the black and white pixels. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-gamma  value</span> Set the gamma correction. <span Class="emphasis">value</span> must be between 0.1 and 10.  The default is 1.0.  This value is applied equally to the R, G and B values.  Those values can be set independently with the , <span Class="manpage">-rgamma</span>, <span Class="manpage">-bgamma</span>and <span Class="bold">-ggamma</span> options.  Not all drivers support this. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ggamma  value</span> Set the green gamma correction. <span Class="emphasis">value</span> must be between 0.1 and 10.  The default is 1.0.  Not all drivers support this.  See also the <span Class="manpage">-gamma</span>, <span Class="manpage">-rgamma</span>and <span Class="bold">-bgamma</span> options. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ignoreABI</span> The <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server checks the ABI revision levels of each module that it loads.  It will normally refuse to load modules with ABI revisions that are newer than the server's.  This is because such modules might use interfaces that the server does not have.  When this option is specified, mismatches like this are downgraded from fatal errors to warnings.  This option should be used with care. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-isolateDevice bus-id</span> Restrict device resets to the device at <span Class="emphasis">bus-id .</span> The <span Class="emphasis">bus-id</span> string has the form 
<p class="level0">(e.g., (oqPCI:1:0:0(cq). At present, only isolation of PCI devices is supported; i.e., this option is ignored if <span Class="emphasis">bustype</span> is anything other than (oqPCI(cq. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-keeptty</span> Prevent the server from detaching its initial controlling terminal. This option is only useful when debugging the server.  Not all platforms support (or can use) this option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-keyboard  keyboard-name</span> Use the xorg.conf(5) file <span Class="bold">InputDevice</span> section called <span Class="emphasis">keyboard-name</span> as the core keyboard.  This option is ignored when the <span Class="bold">Layout</span> section specifies a core keyboard.  In the absence of both a Layout section and this option, the first relevant <span Class="bold">InputDevice</span> section is used for the core keyboard. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-layout  layout-name</span> Use the xorg.conf(5) file <span Class="bold">Layout</span> section called <span Class="emphasis">layout-name .</span> By default the first <span Class="bold">Layout</span> section is used. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-logfile  filename</span> Use the file called <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> as the <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server log file.  The default log file when running as root is <span Class="bold">/var/log/Xorg. n .log</span> and for non root it is <span Class="bold">$XDG_DATA_HOME/xorg/Xorg. n .log</span> where <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is the display number of the <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server.  The default may be in a different directory on some platforms. This option is only available when the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid 0). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-logverbose  [\fIn\fP]</span>Sets the verbosity level for information printed to the <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server log file.  If the <span Class="emphasis">n</span> value isn't supplied, each occurrence of this option increments the log file verbosity level.  When the <span Class="emphasis">n</span> value is supplied, the log file verbosity level is set to that value. The default log file verbosity level is 3. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-modulepath  searchpath</span> Set the module search path to <span Class="emphasis">searchpath .</span> <span Class="emphasis">searchpath</span> is a comma separated list of directories to search for <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server modules.  This option is only available when the server is run as root (i.e, with real-uid 0). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-nosilk</span> Disable Silken Mouse support. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-novtswitch</span> Disable the automatic switching on X server reset and shutdown to the VT that was active when the server started, if supported by the OS. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-pixmap24</span> Set the internal pixmap format for depth 24 pixmaps to 24 bits per pixel. The default is usually 32 bits per pixel.  There is normally little reason to use this option.  Some client applications don't like this pixmap format, even though it is a perfectly legal format.  This is equivalent to the <span Class="bold">Pixmap</span> xorg.conf(5) file option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-pixmap32</span> Set the internal pixmap format for depth 24 pixmaps to 32 bits per pixel. This is usually the default.  This is equivalent to the <span Class="bold">Pixmap</span> xorg.conf(5) file option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-pointer  pointer-name</span> Use the xorg.conf(5) file <span Class="bold">InputDevice</span> section called <span Class="emphasis">pointer-name</span> as the core pointer.  This option is ignored when the <span Class="bold">Layout</span> section specifies a core pointer.  In the absence of both a Layout section and this option, the first relevant <span Class="bold">InputDevice</span> section is used for the core pointer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-quiet</span> Suppress most informational messages at startup.  The verbosity level is set to zero. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-rgamma  value</span> Set the red gamma correction. <span Class="emphasis">value</span> must be between 0.1 and 10.  The default is 1.0.  Not all drivers support this.  See also the <span Class="manpage">-gamma</span>, <span Class="manpage">-bgamma</span>and <span Class="bold">-ggamma</span> options. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-sharevts</span> Share virtual terminals with another X server, if supported by the OS. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-screen  screen-name</span> Use the xorg.conf(5) file <span Class="bold">Screen</span> section called <span Class="emphasis">screen-name .</span> By default the screens referenced by the default <span Class="bold">Layout</span> section are used, or the first <span Class="bold">Screen</span> section when there are no <span Class="bold">Layout</span> sections. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-showconfig</span> This is the same as the <span Class="bold">-version</span> option, and is included for compatibility reasons.  It may be removed in a future release, so the <span Class="bold">-version</span> option should be used instead. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-showDefaultModulePath</span> Print out the default module path the server was compiled with. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-showDefaultLibPath</span> Print out the path libraries should be installed to. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-showopts</span> For each driver module installed, print out the list of options and their argument types. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-weight  nnn</span> Set RGB weighting at 16 bpp.  The default is 565.  This applies only to those drivers which support 16 bpp. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-verbose  [\fIn\fP]</span>Sets the verbosity level for information printed on stderr.  If the <span Class="emphasis">n</span> value isn't supplied, each occurrence of this option increments the verbosity level.  When the <span Class="emphasis">n</span> value is supplied, the verbosity level is set to that value.  The default verbosity level is 0. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-version</span> Print out the server version, patchlevel, release date, the operating system/platform it was built on, and whether it includes module loader support. <a name="KEYBOARD"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">KEYBOARD</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server is normally configured to recognize various special combinations of key presses that instruct the server to perform some action, rather than just sending the key press event to a client application. These actions depend on the XKB keymap loaded by a particular keyboard device and may or may not be available on a given configuration. 
<p class="level0">The following key combinations are commonly part of the default XKEYBOARD keymap. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Ctrl+Alt+Backspace</span> Immediately kills the server -- no questions asked. It can be disabled by setting the <span Class="bold">DontZap</span> xorg.conf(5) file option to a TRUE value. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">It should be noted that zapping is triggered by the <span Class="bold">Terminate_Server</span> action in the keyboard map. This action is not part of the default keymaps but can be enabled with the XKB option <span Class="bold">\*qterminate:ctrl_alt_bksp\*q.</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Plus</span> Change video mode to next one specified in the configuration file. This can be disabled with the <span Class="bold">DontZoom</span> xorg.conf(5) file option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Ctrl+Alt+Keypad-Minus</span> Change video mode to previous one specified in the configuration file. This can be disabled with the <span Class="bold">DontZoom</span> xorg.conf(5) file option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Ctrl+Alt+F1...F12</span> For systems with virtual terminal support, these keystroke combinations are used to switch to virtual terminals 1 through 12, respectively.  This can be disabled with the <span Class="bold">DontVTSwitch</span> xorg.conf(5) file option. <a name="CONFIGURATION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CONFIGURATION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xorg</span> typically uses a configuration file called <span Class="bold">xorg.conf</span> and configuration files with the suffix <span Class="emphasis">.conf</span> in a directory called <span Class="bold">xorg.conf.d</span> for its initial setup. Refer to the xorg.conf(5) manual page for information about the format of this file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xorg</span> has a mechanism for automatically generating a built-in configuration at run-time when no <span Class="bold">xorg.conf</span> file or <span Class="bold">xorg.conf.d</span> files are present.  The current version of this automatic configuration mechanism works in two ways. 
<p class="level0">The first is via enhancements that have made many components of the <span Class="bold">xorg.conf</span> file optional.  This means that information that can be probed or reasonably deduced doesn't need to be specified explicitly, greatly reducing the amount of built-in configuration information that needs to be generated at run-time. 
<p class="level0">The second is to have "safe" fallbacks for most configuration information. This maximises the likelihood that the <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server will start up in some usable configuration even when information about the specific hardware is not available. 
<p class="level0">The automatic configuration support for Xorg is work in progress. It is currently aimed at the most popular hardware and software platforms supported by Xorg.  Enhancements are planned for future releases. <a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">Xorg</span> server config files can be found in a range of locations.  These are documented fully in the xorg.conf(5) manual page.  The most commonly used locations are shown here.
