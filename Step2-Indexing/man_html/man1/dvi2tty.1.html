<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dvi2tty</span> [ options ] dvi-file <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">dvi2tty</span> converts a TeX DVI-file to a format that is appropriate for terminals and line printers. The program is intended to be used for preliminary proofreading of TeX-ed documents. By default the output is directed to the terminal, possibly through a pager (depending on how the program was installed), but it can be directed to a file or a pipe. 
<p class="level0">The output leaves much to be desired, but is still useful if you want to avoid walking to the laser printer (or whatever) for each iteration of your document. <br>Since <span Class="emphasis">dvi2tty</span> produces output for terminals and line printers the representation of documents is naturally quite primitive. In principle Font Changes are totally ignored, but <span Class="emphasis">dvi2tty</span> recognizes a few mathematical and special symbols that can be be displayed on an ordinary ascii terminal, such as the '+' and '-' symbol. 
<p class="level0">If the width of the output text requires more columns than fits in one line (c.f. the -w option) it is broken into several lines by <span Class="emphasis">dvi2tty</span> although they will be printed as one line on regular TeX output devices (e.g. laser printers). To show that a broken line is really just one logical line an asterisk (``*'') in the last position means that the logical line is continued on the next physical line output by <span Class="emphasis">dvi2tty.</span> Such a continuation line is started with a a space and an asterisk in the first two columns. 
<p class="level0">Options may be specified in the environment variable DVI2TTY. Any option on the command line, conflicting with one in the environment, will override the one from the environment. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Options:</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-o file</span> Write output to file ``file''. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p list</span> Print the pages chosen by list. Numbers refer to TeX-page numbers (known as \count0). An example of format for list is ``1,3:6,8'' to choose pages 1, 3 through 6 and 8. Negative numbers can be used exactly as in TeX, e g -1 comes before -4 as in ``-p-1:-4,17''. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-P list</span> Like -p except that page numbers refer to the sequential ordering of the pages in the dvi-file. Negative numbers don't make a lot of sense here... 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-w n</span> Specify terminal width <span Class="emphasis">n.</span> Legal range 16-132. Default is 80. If your terminal has the ability to display in 132 columns it might be a good idea to use -w132 and toggle the terminal into this mode as output will probably look somewhat better. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Specify height of lines. Default value 450000. Allows to adjust linespacing. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-q</span> Don't pipe the output through a pager. This may be the default on some systems (depending on the whims of the person installing the program). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-e n</span> This option can be used to influence the spacing between words. With a negative value the number of spaces  between words becomes less, with a positive value it becomes more. -e-11 seems to worked well. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f</span> Pipe through a pager, $PAGER if defined, or whatever the installer of the program compiled in (often ``more''). This may be the default, but it is still okay to redirect output with ``&gt;'', the pager will not be used if output is not going to a terminal. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-F</span> Specify the pager program to be used. This overrides the $PAGER and the default pager. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Fprog</span> Use ``prog'' as program to pipe output into. Can be used to choose an alternate pager (e g ``-Fless''). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t</span> \tt fonts were used (instead of cm) to produce dvi file. (screen.sty is a powerfull mean to do that with LaTeX). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-a</span> Dvi2tty normally tries to output accented characters. With the -a option, accented characters are output without the accent sign. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l</span> Mark page breaks with the two-character sequence ``^L''. The default is to mark them with a form-feed character. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-c</span> Do not attempt to translate any characters (like the Scandinavion/latin1 mode) except when running in tt-font. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-u</span> Toggle option to process certain latin1 characters. Use this if your output devices supports latin1 cahracters. Note this may interfere with -s. Best not to use -u and -s together. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s</span> Toggle option to process the special Scandinavian characters that on most (?) terminals in Scandinavia are mapped to ``{|}[\]''. Note this may interfere with -u. Best not to use -u and -s together. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-J</span> Auto detect NTT JTeX, ASCII pTeX, and upTeX dvi format. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-N</span> Display NTT JTeX dvi. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-A</span> Display ASCII pTeX dvi. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-U</span> Display upTeX dvi. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Eenc</span> Set output Japanese encoding. The enc argument 'e', 's', 'j', and 'u' denotes EUC-JP, Shift_JIS, ISO-2022-JP, and UTF-8, respectively. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-bdelim</span> Print the name of fonts when switching to it (and ending it). The delim argument is used to delimit the fontname. <a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>

<p class="level0">PAGER &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pager to use. <br>DVI2TTY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can be set to hold command-line options. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>

<p class="level0">Blanks between words get lost quite easy. This is less likely if you are using a wider output than the default 80. 
<p class="level0">Only one file may be specified on the command line.
