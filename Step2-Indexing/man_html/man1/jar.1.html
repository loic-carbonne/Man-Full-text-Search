<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The f3jar</span> tool combines multiple files into a single JAR archive file. f3jar</span> is a general-purpose archiving and compression tool, based on ZIP and the  
<p class="level0">f2ZLIB</span> @ 
<p class="level0"><a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">http://www.gzip.org/zlib/</a> compression format. However, f3jar</span> was designed mainly package java applets or applications into a single archive. When the components of an applet or application (files, images and sounds) are combined into a single archive, they can be downloaded by a java agent (like a browser) in a single HTTP transaction, rather than requiring a new connection for each piece. This dramatically improves download times. f3jar</span> also compresses files and so further improves download time. In addition, it allows individual entries in a file to be signed by the applet author so that their origin can be authenticated. The syntax for the jar tool is almost identical to the syntax for the f2tar</span> command. A f3jar</span> archive can be used as a class path entry, whether or not it is compressed.  
<p class="level0">Typical usage to combine files into a jar file is: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
f3
% jar cf myFile.jar *.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In this example, all the class files in the current directory are placed into the file named f2myFile.jar</span>. The jar tool automatically generates a manifest file entry named f2META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</span>. It is always the first entry in the jar file. The manifest file declares meta-information about the archive, and stores that data as f2name&nbsp;:&nbsp;value</span> pairs. Refer to the  
<p class="level0">f2JAR file specification</span> @ 
<p class="level0"><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html&#35;JAR%20Manifest">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html&#35;JAR%20Manifest</a> for details explaining how the jar tool stores meta-information in the manifest file.  
<p class="level0">If a jar file should include f2name&nbsp;:&nbsp;value</span> pairs contained in an existing manifest file, specify that file using the f2-m</span> option: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
f3
% jar cmf myManifestFile myFile.jar *.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">An existing manifest file must end with a new line character.&nbsp; f3jar</span> does not parse the last line of a manifest file if it does not end with a new line character. <br>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><br>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">f3Note:&nbsp;</span> A jar command that specifies f2cfm</span> on the command line instead of f2cmf</span> (the order of the m and -f options are reversed), the f3jar</span> command line must specify the name of the jar archive first, followed by the name of the manifest file:  <pre class="level0">
f3
% jar cfm myFile.jar myManifestFile *.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The manifest is in a text format inspired by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt">RFC 822</a> ASCII format, so it is easy to view and process manifest-file contents.  
<p class="level0">To extract the files from a jar file, use f2x</span>: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
f3
% jar xf myFile.jar
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">To extract individual files from a jar file, supply their filenames: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
f3
% jar xf myFile.jar foo bar
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Beginning with version 1.3 of the JDK, the f2jar</span> utility supports  
<p class="level0">f2JarIndex</span> @ 
<p class="level0"><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html&#35;JAR_Index,">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jar.html&#35;JAR_Index,</a> which allows application class loaders to load classes more efficiently from jar files. If an application or applet is bundled into multiple jar files,&nbsp; only the necessary jar files will be downloaded and opened to load classes. This performance optimization is enabled by running f2jar</span> with the f2-i</span>option. It will generate package location information for the specified main jar file and all the jar files it depends on, which need to be specified in the f2Class-Path</span> attribute of the main jar file's manifest. 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
f3
% jar i main.jar
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In this example, an f2INDEX.LIST</span> file is inserted into the f2META-INF</span> directory of f2main.jar</span>. <br><br>The application class loader uses the information stored in this file for efficient class loading.&nbsp; For details about how location information is stored in the index file, refer to the f2JarIndex</span> specification. <br><br>To copy directories, first compress files in f2dir1</span> to f2stdout</span>, then extract from f2stdin</span> to f2dir2</span> (omitting the f2-f</span> option from both f2jar</span> commands): 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
f3
% (cd dir1; jar c .) | (cd dir2; jar x)
</span>

<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">c  Creates a new archive file named f2jarfile</span> (if f2f</span> is specified) or to standard output (if f2f</span> and f2jarfile</span> are omitted). Add to it the files and directories specified by f2inputfiles</span>.  
<p class="level1">u  Updates an existing file f2jarfile</span> (when f2f</span> is specified) by adding to it files and directories specified by f2inputfiles</span>. For example:  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar uf foo.jar foo.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">would add the file f2foo.class</span> to the existing jar file f2foo.jar</span>. The f2-u</span> option can also update the manifest entry, as given by this example:  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar umf manifest foo.jar
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">updates the f2foo.jar</span> manifest with the f2name : value</span> pairs in f2manifest</span>.  
<p class="level1">x  Extracts files and directories from f2jarfile</span> (if f2f</span> is specified) or standard input (if f2f</span> and f2jarfile</span> are omitted). If f2inputfiles</span> is specified, only those specified files and directories are extracted. Otherwise, all files and directories are extracted. The time and date of the extracted files are those given in the archive.  
<p class="level1">t  Lists the table of contents from f2jarfile</span> (if f2f</span> is specified) or standard input (if f2f</span> and f2jarfile</span> are omitted). If f2inputfiles</span> is specified, only those specified files and directories are listed. Otherwise, all files and directories are listed.  
<p class="level1">i  Generate index information for the specified f2jarfile</span> and its dependent jar files. For example:  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar i foo.jar
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">would generate an f2INDEX.LIST</span> file in f2foo.jar</span> which contains location information for each package in f2foo.jar</span> and all the jar files specified in the f2Class-Path</span> attribute of f2foo.jar</span>. See the index example.   
<p class="level1">f  Specifies the file f2jarfile</span> to be created (f2c</span>), updated (f2u</span>), extracted (f2x</span>), indexed (f2i</span>), or viewed (f2t</span>). The f2-f</span> option and filename f2jarfile</span> are a pair -- if present, they must both appear. Omitting f2f</span> and f2jarfile</span> accepts a jar file name from f2stdin</span>(for x and t) or sends jar file to f2stdout</span> (for c and u).  
<p class="level1">v  Generates verbose output to standard output. Examples shown below.  
<p class="level1">0  (zero) Store without using ZIP compression.  
<p class="level1">M  Do not create a manifest file entry (for c and u), or delete a manifest file entry if one exists (for u).  
<p class="level1">m  Includes f2name : value</span> attribute pairs from the specified manifest file f2manifest</span> in the file at f2META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</span>. f2jar</span> adds a f2name&nbsp;:&nbsp;value</span> pair unless an entry already exists with the same name, in which case f2jar</span> updates its value. <br><br>On the command line, the letters f3m</span> and f3f</span> must appear in the same order that f2manifest</span> and f2jarfile</span> appear. Example use:  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar cmf myManifestFile myFile.jar *.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">You can add special-purpose f2name&nbsp;:&nbsp;value</span> attribute pairs to the manifest that aren't contained in the default manifest. For example, you can add attributes specifying vendor information, version information, package sealing, or to make JAR-bundled applications executable. See the  
<p class="level1">f2Packaging Programs in JAR Files</span> @ 
<p class="level1"><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/</a> lesson in the Java Tutorial for examples of using the f4-m</span> option.  
<p class="level1">e  Sets f2entrypoint</span> as the application entry point for stand-alone applications bundled into executable jar file. The use of this option creates or overrides the f2Main-Class</span> attribute value in the manifest file. This option can be used during creation of jar file or while updating the jar file. This option specifies the application entry point without editing or creating the manifest file. <br><br><br>For example, this command creates f2Main.jar</span> where the f2Main-Class</span> attribute value in the manifest is set to f2Main</span>:  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar cfe Main.jar Main Main.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">The java runtime can directly invoke this application by running the following command:  <pre class="level1">
f3
java -jar Main.jar
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">If the entrypoint class name is in a package it may use either a dot (".") or slash ("/") character as the delimiter. For example, if f2Main.class</span> is in a package called f2foo</span> the entry point can be specified in the following ways:  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar -cfe Main.jar foo/Main foo/Main.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">or  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar -cfe Main.jar foo.Main foo/Main.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">f3Note:&nbsp;</span> specifying both f2-m</span> and f2-e</span> options together when the given manifest also contains the f2Main-Class</span> attribute results in an ambigous f2Main.class</span> specification, leading to an error and the jar creation or update operation is aborted.   
<p class="level1">-C&nbsp;dir  Temporarily changes directories (f2cd</span>&nbsp;f2dir</span>) during execution of the f2jar</span> command while processing the following f2inputfiles</span> argument. Its operation is intended to be similar to the f2-C</span> option of the UNIX f2tar</span> utility. <br><br>For example, this command changes to the f2classes</span> directory and adds the f2bar.class</span> from that directory to f2foo.jar</span>:  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar uf foo.jar -C classes bar.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">This command changes to the f2classes</span> directory and adds to f2foo.jar</span> all files within the f2classes</span> directory (without creating a classes directory in the jar file), then changes back to the original directory before changing to the f2bin</span> directory to add f2xyz.class</span> to f2foo.jar</span>.  <pre class="level1">
f3
jar uf foo.jar -C classes . -C bin xyz.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">If f2classes</span> holds files f2bar1</span> and f2bar2</span>, then here's what the jar file will contain using f2jar tf foo.jar</span>:  <pre class="level1">
f3
META-INF/
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
bar1
bar2
xyz.class
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">-Joption  Pass f2option</span> to the Java runtime environment, where f2option</span> is one of the options described on the reference page for the java application launcher. For example, f4-J-Xmx48M</span> sets the maximum memory to 48 megabytes. It is a common convention for f2-J</span> to pass options to the underlying runtime environment.  
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="COMMAND"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT FILES</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">To shorten or simplify the jar command line, you can specify one or more files that themselves contain arguments to the f2jar</span> command (except f2-J</span> options). This enables you to create jar commands of any length, overcoming command line limits imposed by the operating system.  
<p class="level0">An argument file can include options and filenames. The arguments within a file can be space-separated or newline-separated. Filenames within an argument file are relative to the current directory, not relative to the location of the argument file. Wildcards (*) that might otherwise be expanded by the operating system shell are not expanded. Use of the f2@</span> character to recursively interpret files is not supported. The f2-J</span> options are not supported because they are passed to the launcher, which does not support argument files. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When executing f2jar</span>, pass in the path and name of each argument file with the f2@</span> leading character. When f2jar</span> encounters an argument beginning with the character f2@</span>, it expands the contents of that file into the argument list. <br><br>The example below, f2classes.list</span> holds the names of files output by a f2find</span> command:  
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
f3
% find </span>f3.</span> -name '*.class' -print &gt; classes.list
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">You can then execute the f2jar</span> command on f2Classes.list</span> by passing it to f2jar</span> using argfile syntax: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
f3
% jar cf my.jar @classes.list
</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">An argument file can specify a path, but any filenames inside the argument file that have relative paths are relative to the current working directory, not to the path passed in. Here is an example:  <pre class="level0">
f3
% jar @path1/classes.list
</span>
