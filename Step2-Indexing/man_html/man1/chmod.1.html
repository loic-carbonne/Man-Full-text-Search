<p class="level0">This manual page documents the GNU version of <span Class="manpage">chmod .</span><span Class="bold">chmod</span> changes the file mode bits of each given file according to <span Class="emphasis">mode ,</span> which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits. 
<p class="level0">The format of a symbolic mode is [c <span Class="bold">ugoa</span>.|.|.][[<span Class="bold">-+=</span>][<span Class="emphasis">perms</span>.|.|.].|.|.], where <span Class="emphasis">perms</span> is either zero or more letters from the set <span Class="bold">rwxXst</span>, or a single letter from the set <span Class="bold">ugo</span>. Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas. 
<p class="level0">A combination of the letters <span Class="bold">ugoa</span> controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (<span Class="bold">u</span>), other users in the file's group (<span Class="bold">g</span>), other users not in the file's group (<span Class="bold">o</span>), or all users (<span Class="bold">a</span>).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if (<span Class="bold">a</span>) were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected. 
<p class="level0">The operator <span Class="bold">+</span> causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; <span Class="bold">-</span> causes them to be removed; and <span Class="bold">=</span> causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected. 
<p class="level0">The letters <span Class="bold">rwxXst</span> select file mode bits for the affected users: read (<span Class="bold">r</span>), write (<span Class="bold">w</span>), execute (or search for directories) (<span Class="bold">x</span>), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (<span Class="bold">X</span>), set user or group ID on execution (<span Class="bold">s</span>), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (<span Class="bold">t</span>).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters <span Class="bold">ugo</span>: the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (<span Class="bold">u</span>), the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's group (<span Class="bold">g</span>), and the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (<span Class="bold">o</span>). 
<p class="level0">A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros. The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the same values. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">chmod</span> never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the <span Class="bold">chmod</span> system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used. However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, <span Class="bold">chmod</span> changes the permissions of the pointed-to file. In contrast, <span Class="bold">chmod</span> ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals. <a name="SETUID"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SETUID AND SETGID BITS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">chmod</span> clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of the user's supplementary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of <span Class="emphasis">MODE</span> or <span Class="emphasis">RFILE</span> to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the underlying <span Class="bold">chmod</span> system call.  When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">chmod</span> preserves a directory's set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like <span Class="bold">u+s</span> and <span Class="manpage">g-s</span>and you can set (but not clear) the bits with a numeric mode. <a name="RESTRICTED"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT</h2>
<p class="level0">The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the <span Class="emphasis">restricted deletion flag</span> for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories like <span Class="bold">/tmp</span>.  For regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called the <span Class="emphasis">sticky bit .</span> <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
