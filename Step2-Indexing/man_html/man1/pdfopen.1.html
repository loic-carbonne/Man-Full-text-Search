<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-h, --help, -?</span> output help and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v, --version, -V</span> output the version number and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p &lt;n&gt;, --page &lt;n&gt;</span> when starting the viewer, display page &lt;n&gt; of the document (notes: not all viewers support this feature, and even in those cases this option only has effect when the document is initially loaded).  This option is over-ridden by <span Class="bold">-g</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-g &lt;named destination&gt;, --goto &lt;named destination&gt;</span> when starting the viewer, display the page of the document containing the named destination (notes: not all viewers support this feature, and even in those cases this option only has effect when the document is initially loaded). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-r, --reset_focus</span> after sending commands to the PDF viewer, attempt to reset the input focus to the window which had focus before the commands were sent. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-viewer, --viewer &lt;ar9|ar9-tab|ar8|ar7|ar5|xpdf|evince&gt;</span> use (respectively) Adobe Reader 9 (in a new window), Adobe Reader 9 (in a new tab of a running AR9, if any), Adobe Reader 8, Adobe Reader 7, Adobe Reader 5, xpdf or evince as the PDF viewer program. Adobe Reader 9 (in a new window) is the default. 
<p class="level0"><a name="RATIONALE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">RATIONALE</h2>
<p class="level0">At certain points of TeX document preparation, many people repeat a "edit-compile-view" cycle.  Since PDF viewers such as Adobe's Acrobat Reader ("<span Class="bold">acroread</span>") do not automatically refresh the display when the PDF file changes, this cycle can be more cumbersome than desired. The <span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> program provides the ability to automate the reloading of the PDF document when it is changed. 
<p class="level0">Note: there seems to be little need for <span Class="bold">pdfclose</span> under GNU/Linux, since (unlike the situation for MS windows) <span Class="bold">acroread</span> does not lock the PDF file, which would prevent <span Class="bold">pdftex</span> (or a DVI to PDF converter) from creating a new version of the PDF output file.  However, <span Class="bold">pdfclose</span> is provided in case someone finds it useful. 
<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> searches for an instance of the specified (or default) PDF viewer displaying the specified PDF file. If there is already an instance of the given viewer displaying the given file, the viewer is instructed to reload the file.  If no such instance is found, <span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> attempts to run the specified viewer on the specified document. 
<p class="level0">The default viewer is "<span Class="bold">acroread</span>", which could start any one of a number of versions of Acrobat Reader, depending on what is installed on your system.  However, the commands to reload the current document vary from one version of <span Class="bold">acroread</span> to another; consequently, if you are using a version of <span Class="bold">acroread</span> other than AR9, you should explicitly specify the viewer program. 
<p class="level0">This version of <span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> accepts the following viewer options: <br><span Class="emphasis">ar9</span>, <span Class="emphasis">ar9-tab</span>, <span Class="emphasis">ar8</span>, <span Class="emphasis">ar7</span>, <span Class="emphasis">ar5</span>, <span Class="emphasis">xpdf</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">evince</span>. <br>The difference between <span Class="emphasis">ar9</span> and <span Class="emphasis">ar9-tab</span> is significant when there is no instance of AR9 already displaying the requested document.  In this situation, while <span Class="emphasis">ar9</span> will request <span Class="bold">acroread</span> to create a new instance of <span Class="bold">acroread</span> (and thus open a new window) by using the <span Class="bold">-openInNewInstance</span> argument, <span Class="emphasis">ar9-tab</span> starts <span Class="bold">acroread</span> without this argument; if there is already an instance of <span Class="bold">acroread</span> running, a new tab will be opened in an existing window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pdfclose</span> searches for one of the above PDF viewers displaying the given file and instructs the viewer to "close" the window.  In most cases, the PDF viewer continues to run, possibly now displaying just a blank window.  (This behaviour varies somewhat from one PDF viewer to another.) 
<p class="level0"><a name="PORTABILITY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PORTABILITY AND AVAILABILITY</h2>
<p class="level0">These programs have been tested on Slackware64 Version 14.1 and a few other versions / distributions of GNU/Linux.  The code is reasonably generic and should work out of the box using most recent X11 implementations.  (Reports to the contrary are welcome, particularly if they come with robust fixes.) 
<p class="level0">These programs are designed for X11-based systems.  If you somehow find compiled versions of these programs on a system using another window system, they are very unlikely to be of any use to you. 
<p class="level0">Source and binaries of the programs can be downloaded from  f(CWCTAN://support/xpdfopen/</span> (e.g., f(CWhttp://mirror.ctan.org/support/xpdfopen</span>). 
<p class="level0"><a name="CAVEATS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CAVEATS</h2>
<p class="level0">If you use <span Class="emphasis">ar9-tab</span> to reload the PDF document and the instance of <span Class="bold">acroread</span> with the given document is currently displaying some other document, the command causes your document to be displayed, but not reloaded. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> works by looking for a window with a name (window title) matching that expected for the given viewer and document.  If for some reason your viewer's window name is not as expected, <span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> may not work for you. 
<p class="level0">With at least AR9 and some window managers, using <span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> to reload the document gives focus to the <span Class="bold">acroread</span> window, even though the mouse cursor is not necessarily in that window.  This can be annoying.  The <span Class="bold">-reset_focus</span> option can be used to deal with this problem.

<p class="level0">This manual page was written by Jim Diamond &lt;f(CWJim.Diamond@acadiau.ca</span>&gt;. I am the current maintainer of the X11 versions of <span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> and <span Class="bold">pdfclose</span>. Report any bugs you find to me.  Feature enhancement requests are welcome, coded enhancements even more so. 
<p class="level0">Past authors: Fabrice Popineau wrote the MS-windows versions of <span Class="bold">pdfopen</span> and <span Class="bold">pdfclose</span> upon which these programs were originally based. Taco Hoekwater created the GNU/Linux versions, up to Version 0.61 (including some documentation which inspired parts of this man page). Peter Breitenlohner has contributed both code and suggestions to versions later than 0.61.
