<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> is a program for previewing <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> files, as produced e.g. by the <span Class="manpage">tex (1)</span>program, under the X window system. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> can show the file shrunken by various integer factors, and it has a ``magnifying glass'' for viewing parts of the page enlarged (see the section MAGNIFIER below). This version of <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> is also referred to as <span Class="bold">xdvik</span> since it uses the kpathsea library to locate and generate font files. In addition to that, it supports the following features: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">- hyperlinks in DVI files (section HYPERLINKS), 
<p class="level1">- direct rendering of PostScript&lt;tm&gt; Type 1 fonts (section TYPE 1 FONTS), 
<p class="level1">- source specials in the DVI file (section SOURCE SPECIALS), 
<p class="level1">- string search in DVI files (section STRING SEARCH), 
<p class="level1">- saving or printing (parts of) the DVI file (sections PRINT DIALOG and SAVE DIALOG). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> can be compiled with the Motif toolkit or the Xaw (Athena) toolkit (and variants of it), and the Motif version has a slightly different GUI; these differences are noted below. 
<p class="level0">Before displaying a page of a DVI file, <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> will check to see if the file has changed since the last time it was displayed.  If this is the case, it will reload the file.  This feature allows you to preview many versions of the same file while running <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> only once. Since it cannot read partial DVI files, <span Class="bold">xdvik</span> versions starting from 22.74.3 will create a temporary copy of the DVI file being viewed, to ensure that the file can be viewed without interruptions. (The <span Class="bold">-notempfile</span> can be used to turn off this feature). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> can show PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials by any of three methods. It will try first to use Display PostScript&lt;tm&gt;, then NeWS, then it will try to use Ghostscript to render the images.  All of these options depend on additional software to work properly; moreover, some of them may not be compiled into this copy of <span Class="manpage">xdvi .</span>
<p class="level0">For performance reasons, <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> does not render PostScript specials in the magnifying glass. 
<p class="level0">If no file name has been specified on the command line, xdvi will try to open the most recently opened file; if the file history (accessible via the <span Class="bold">File &gt; Open Recent</span> menu) is empty, or if none of the files in the history are valid DVI files, it will pop up a file selector for choosing a file name. (In previous versions, which didn't have a file history, the file selector was always used; you can set the X resource <span Class="bold">noFileArgUseHistory</span> to <span Class="emphasis">false</span> to get back the old behaviour.) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">In addition to specifying the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file (with or without the <span Class="bold">.dvi</span> extension), <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> supports the following command line options.  If the option begins with a 
<p class="level0">instead of a 
<p class="level0">the option is restored to its default value.  By default, these options can be set via the resource names given in parentheses in the description of each option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+ page</span> Specifies the first page to show.  If <span Class="bold">+</span> is given without a number, the last page is assumed; the first page is the default. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-allowshell</span> 
<p class="level0">This option enables the shell escape in PostScript specials. (For security reasons, shell escapes are disabled by default.) This option should be rarely used; in particular it should not be used just to uncompress files: that function is done automatically if the file name ends in <span Class="manpage">.Z</span>, <span Class="manpage">.gz</span>or <span Class="manpage">.bz2 .</span>Shell escapes are always turned off if the <span Class="bold">-safer</span> option is used. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-altfont  font</span> 
<p class="level0">Declares a default font to use when the font in the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file cannot be found.  This is useful, for example, with PostScript &lt;tm&gt; fonts. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-anchorposition  anchor</span> Jump to <span Class="emphasis">anchor</span> after opening the DVI file. This is only useful when invoking <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> from other applications. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-background  color</span> 
<p class="level0">Determines the color of the background.  Same as <span Class="manpage">-bg .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-bg  color</span> 
<p class="level0">Determines the color of the background. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-browser  browser</span> 
<p class="level0">Defines the web browser used for handling external URLs. The value of this option or resource has the same syntax as the <span Class="bold">BROWSER</span> environment variable; see the explanation of that variable in the section `ENVIRONMENT' below for a detailed description. If neither the option nor the X resource <span Class="emphasis">wwwBrowser</span> is specified, the environment variables <span Class="bold">BROWSER</span> and <span Class="bold">WWWBROWSER</span> (in that order) are used to determine the browser command. If these are not set either, the following default value is used: <span Class="bold">xdg-open %s:htmlview %s:firefox -remote -remote "openURL(%s,new-window)":mozilla -remote "openURL(%s,new-window)":netscape -raise -remote "openURL(%s,new-window)":xterm -e w3m %s:xterm -e lynx %s:xterm -e wget %s</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-copy</span> 
<p class="level0">Always use the <span Class="emphasis">copy</span> operation when writing characters to the display. This option may be necessary for correct operation on a color display, but overstrike characters will be incorrect. If greyscale anti-aliasing is in use, the <span Class="bold">-copy</span> operation will disable the use of colorplanes and make overstrikes come out incorrectly. See also <span Class="manpage">-thorough .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-cr  color</span> 
<p class="level0">Determines the color of the mouse cursor.  The default is the same as the foreground color. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-debug  bitmask|string[,string ...]</span> 
<p class="level0">If nonzero, prints additional information on standard output.  The argument can be either a bitmask specified as a decimal number, or comma-separated list of strings. <br>For the bitmask representation, multiple values can be specified by adding the numbers that represent the individual bits; e.g. to debug all all file searching and opening commands, use 4032 (= 2048 + 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64). Use -1 to turn on debugging of everything (this will produce huge output). <br>For the string representation, use the strings listed in the following table, with a comma to separate the values; e.g. to debug all file searching and opening commands, use <span Class="manpage">search</span>, <span Class="manpage">expand</span>, <span Class="manpage">paths</span>, <span Class="manpage">hash</span>, <span Class="manpage">stat</span>, <span Class="manpage">open .</span>(The option `kpathsea' is provided as a shorthand for these.) Note that such a list may need to be quoted to prevent the shell from interpreting commas or spaces in the list. <br>The individual numbers and strings have the following meanings: <pre class="level0">
	1	bitmap	Bitmap creation
	2	dvi	DVI translation
	4	pk	PK fonts
	8	batch	Batch mode: Exit after
			reading the DVI file
	16	event	Event handling
	32	ps	PostScript interpreter calls
	64	stat	Kpathsea stat(2) calls
	128	hash	Kpathsea hash table lookups
	256	open	Kpathsea file opening
	512	paths	Kpathsea path definitions
	1024	expand	Kpathsea path expansion
	2048	search	Kpathsea searching
	4032	kpathsea	All Kpathsea options
	4096	htex	Hypertex specials
	8192	src	Source specials
	16384	client	Client/server mode (see -unique
			and -sourceposition options)
	32768	ft	FreeType library messages (Type 1 fonts)
	65536	ft_verbose	Verbose FreeType library messages (currently unused)
	131072	gui	GUI elements
</pre>

<p class="level0">Some of the Kpathsea debugging options are actually provided by Kpathsea; see the Debugging section in the Kpathsea manual for more information on these. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-density  density</span> 
<p class="level0">Determines the density used when shrinking bitmaps for fonts. A higher value produces a lighter font.  The default value is 40. If greyscaling is in use, this argument does not apply; use <span Class="bold">-gamma</span> instead. See also the 
<p class="level0">keystroke. Same as <span Class="manpage">-S .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-display  host : display</span> Specifies the host and screen to be used for displaying the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file.  By default this is obtained from the environment variable 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-dvipspath  path</span> 
<p class="level0">Use <span Class="emphasis">path</span> as the <span Class="bold">dvips</span> program to use when printing.  The default for this is <span Class="manpage">dvips .</span>The program or script should read the DVI file from standard input, and write the PostScript file to standard output. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-editor  editor</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the editor that will be invoked when the <span Class="emphasis">source-special()</span> action is triggered to start a reverse search (by default via Ctrl-Mouse 1). The argument to this option is a format string in which occurrences of 
<p class="level0">are replaced by the file name, occurrences of 
<p class="level0">are replaced by the line number within the file, and optional occurrences of 
<p class="level0">are replaced by the column number within the line. 
<p class="level0">If neither the option nor the X resource <span Class="emphasis">.editor</span> is specified, the following environment variables are checked to determine the editor command: <span Class="manpage">XEDITOR</span>, <span Class="manpage">VISUAL</span>and <span Class="bold">EDITOR</span> (in this sequence). If the string is found as the value of the 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level0">environment variables, then 
<p class="level0">is prepended to the string; if the editor is specified by other means, then it must be in the form of a shell command to pop up an X window with an editor in it. If none of these variables is set, a warning message is displayed and the command 
<p class="level0">is used. 
<p class="level0">If no 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level0">occurs in the string, the missing format strings are appended automatically. (This is for compatibility with other programs when using one of the environment variables). 
<p class="level0">A new instance of the editor is started each time this command is used; therefore it is preferable to use an editor that can be invoked in `client' mode to load new files into the same instance. Example settings are: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">(older Emacsen) 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">(XEmacs and newer Emacsen) 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">(VIM v6.0+; the `--servername xdvi' option will cause gvim to run a dedicated instance for the files opened by xdvi.) 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">(nedit) 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Note that those strings need to be enclosed into quotes when using them on the command-line to protect them from the shell; when using them as argument for the <span Class="emphasis">.editor</span> resource in an X resource file, no quotes should be used. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">NOTE ON SECURITY:</span> The argument of this option isn't executed as a shell command, but via <span Class="emphasis">exec()</span> to prevent evil tricks with the contents of source specials. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-expert</span> This option is only supported for backwards compatibility; it is equivalent to <span Class="manpage">-expertmode 0</span>which should be preferred. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-expertmode  flag</span> 
<p class="level0">With an argument of <span Class="emphasis">0 ,</span> this option switches off the display of the buttons, scrollbars, the toolbar (Motif only), the statusline and the page list. These GUI elements can also be (de)activated separately, by combining the appropriate values in the <span Class="emphasis">flag</span> argument. This acts similar to the <span Class="bold">-debug</span> option: The integer <span Class="emphasis">flag</span> is treated as a bitmap where each bit represents one element. If the bit has the value <span Class="emphasis">1 ,</span> the element is switched on, if it has the value <span Class="emphasis">0 ,</span> the element is switched off. The meaning of the bits is as follows: <pre class="level0">
	1	statusline
	2	scrollbars
	4	Motif: pagelist, Xaw: buttons and pagelist
	8	toolbar (Motif only)
	16	menubar (Motif only)
</pre>

<p class="level0">For example, to turn on only the statusline and the scrollbars, use 3 (= 1 + 2). See also the 
<p class="level0">keystroke, where the bits are addressed by their positions, from 1 to 3 (Xaw) or 5 (Motif), respectively. 
<p class="level0">If the statusline is not active, all messages that would normally be printed to the statusline will be printed to <span Class="emphasis">stdout ,</span> unless the <span Class="bold">-hushstdout</span> option is used. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-fg  color</span> 
<p class="level0">Determines the color of the text (foreground). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-findstring string</span> This option triggers a search for <span Class="emphasis">string</span> in the DVI file mentioned on the command-line, similar to forward search (see the description of the <span Class="bold">sourceposition</span> option): If there is already another instance of <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> running on the displaying that DVI file, it will cause that instance to perform the search instead. The search starts at the top of the current page of the DVI file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-font  font</span> 
<p class="level0">Sets the font used in menus, buttons etc., as described in the <span Class="emphasis">X(7x)</span> man page. The font for child windows can be set separately, e.g.: 
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
xdvi*statusline*font: e
&nbsp;  -*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-foreground  color</span> Same as <span Class="manpage">-fg .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-fullscreen</span> When this option is used, xdvi will (try to) run in fullscreen mode, with no window decorations. This option is not guaranteed to work with all windowmanagers/desktops; if you're experiencing problems with it, please use the <span Class="bold">-geometry</span> option instead, and a suitable window manager setting to remove the window decorations. When using this option for presentations, you might want to get rid of all the control widgets as well, using the <span Class="bold">-expertmode</span> option. This option can also be toggled at runtime using the <span Class="bold">fullscreen</span> action (by default bound to Ctrl-l). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-gamma  gamma</span> 
<p class="level0">Controls the interpolation of colors in the greyscale anti-aliasing color palette.  Default value is 1.0.  For 0 &lt; <span Class="emphasis">gamma</span> &lt; 1, the fonts will be lighter (more like the background), and for <span Class="emphasis">gamma</span> &gt; 1, the fonts will be darker (more like the foreground).  Negative values behave the same way, but use a slightly different algorithm. For color and grayscale displays; for monochrome, see <span Class="manpage">-density .</span>See also the 
<p class="level0">keystroke. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-geometry  geometry</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the initial geometry of the main window, as described in the <span Class="emphasis">X(7x)</span> man page. The geometry of child windows can be set separately, e.g.: <br><span Class="emphasis">xdvi*helpwindow.geometry: 600x800</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-gsalpha</span> 
<p class="level0">Causes <span Class="bold">Ghostscript</span> to be called with the <span Class="bold">x11alpha</span> driver instead of the <span Class="bold">x11</span> driver.  The <span Class="bold">x11alpha</span> driver enables anti-aliasing in PostScript specials, for a nicer appearance. It is available on newer versions of <span Class="manpage">Ghostscript .</span>This option can also be toggled with the 
<p class="level0">keystroke. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-gspalette  palette</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the palette to be used when using Ghostscript for rendering PostScript specials.  Possible values are <span Class="manpage">Color</span>, <span Class="manpage">Greyscale</span>and <span Class="manpage">Monochrome .</span>The default is <span Class="manpage">Color .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-h</span>, <span Class="manpage">-help</span>, <span Class="manpage">--help</span>Prints a short help text with an overview of the command-line options to standard output. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-hl  color</span> 
<p class="level0">Determines the color of the page border, of the ruler in `ruler mode', and of the highlighting markers in forward search and string search. The default is the foreground color. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-hush</span> 
<p class="level0">Causes <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> to suppress all suppressible warnings. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-hushbell</span> 
<p class="level0">Don't sound the X bell when an error occurs. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-hushchars</span> 
<p class="level0">Causes <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> to suppress warnings about references to characters which are not defined in the font. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-hushchecksums</span> 
<p class="level0">Causes <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> to suppress warnings about checksum mismatches between the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file and the font file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-hushstdout</span> 
<p class="level0">Suppresses printing of status messages to <span Class="emphasis">stdout .</span> Note that errors or warnings will still be printed to <span Class="emphasis">stderr</span> even if this option is used. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-icongeometry  geometry</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the initial position for the icon. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-iconic</span> 
<p class="level0">Causes the <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> window to start in the iconic state.  The default is to start with the window open. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-install</span> 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> is running under a <span Class="bold">PseudoColor</span> visual, then (by default) it will check for <span Class="bold">TrueColor</span> visuals with more bits per pixel, and switch to such a visual if one exists. If no such visual exists, it will use the current visual and colormap.  If <span Class="bold">-install</span> is selected, however, it will still use a <span Class="bold">TrueColor</span> visual with a greater depth, if one is available; otherwise, it will install its own colormap on the current visual.  If the current visual is not <span Class="manpage">PseudoColor</span>then <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> will not switch the visual or colormap, regardless of its options. The default value of the <span Class="bold">install</span> resource is the special value, <span Class="manpage">maybe .</span>There is no <span Class="bold">+install</span> option.  See also <span Class="manpage">-noinstall</span>and the GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS section. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-interpreter  filename</span> 
<p class="level0">Use <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> as the Ghostscript interpreter.  By default it uses <span Class="manpage">gs .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-keep</span> 
<p class="level0">Sets a flag to indicate that <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> should not move to the home position when moving to a new page.  See also the 
<p class="level0">keystroke. This flag is honored by all page switching actions and by <span Class="bold">up-or-previous() /</span> <span Class="manpage">down-or-next()</span>although the latter only honor the horizontal postion, not the vertical one. This allows for a "continuous" scrolling back an forth through a document with a display window narrower than a page width.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-margins  dimen</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the size of both the top margin and side margin. This determines the ``home'' position of the page within the window as follows.  If the entire page fits in the window, then the margin settings are ignored.  If, even after removing the margins from the left, right, top, and bottom, the page still cannot fit in the window, then the page is put in the window such that the top and left margins are hidden, and presumably the upper left-hand corner of the text on the page will be in the upper left-hand corner of the window. Otherwise, the text is centered in the window. The dimension should be a decimal number optionally followed by any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by *(Te

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-mfmode  mode-def</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies a <span Class="emphasis">mode-def</span> string, which can be used in searching for fonts (see ENVIRONMENT, below). Generally, when changing the <span Class="emphasis">mode-def ,</span> it is also necessary to change the font size to the appropriate value for that mode.  This is done by adding a colon and the value in dots per inch; for example, <span Class="manpage">-mfmode ljfour:600 .</span>This method overrides any value given by the <span Class="bold">pixelsPerInch</span> resource or the <span Class="bold">-p</span> command-line argument.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-nofork</span> 
<p class="level0">With the <span Class="bold">-sourceposition</span> and <span Class="bold">-unique</span> options, the default behavior is for <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> to put itself into the background (like a daemon) if there is no appropriate instance of <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> already running. This argument makes it run in the foreground instead.  This is useful for debugging, or if your client application cannot deal well with a program self-backgrounding itself in this way -- e.g., the IPC functions in <span Class="bold">emacs</span> are known to have problems with this. If no <span Class="bold">-sourceposition</span> or <span Class="bold">-unique</span> argument is given, then this option has no effect.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-noomega</span> 
<p class="level0">This will disable the use of Omega extensions when interpreting DVI files. By default, the additional opcodes <span Class="emphasis">129</span> and <span Class="emphasis">134</span> are recognized by xdvi as Omega extensions and interpreted as requests to set 2-byte characters. The only drawback is that the virtual font array will require 65536 positions instead of the default 256 positions, i.e. the memory requirements of xdvi will be slightly larger. If you find this unacceptable or encounter another problem with the Omega extensions, you can switch this extension off by using <span Class="bold">-noomega</span> (but please do send a bug report if you find such problems - see the bug address in the <a class="bold" href="#AUTHORS">AUTHORS</a> section below). <br>(Note: <span Class="bold">-noomega</span> corresponds to <span Class="manpage">omega: off ;</span><span Class="bold">+noomega</span> to <span Class="manpage">omega: on .)</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-noscan</span> 
<p class="level0">By default, <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> does a preliminary scan of the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file to process any <span Class="bold">papersize</span> specials; this is especially important at startup since the paper size may be needed to determine the window size. If PostScript&lt;tm&gt; is in use, then prescanning is also necessary in order to properly process header files. In addition, prescanning is needed to correctly determine the background color of a page. This option turns off such prescanning. (Prescanning will be automatically be turned back on if <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> detects any of the specials mentioned above.)

In this case, exposing parts of the window while the DVI file is being written by *(Te will erase the current window contents until the DVI file can be completely reread. <br>(Note: <span Class="bold">-notempfile</span> corresponds to <span Class="manpage">tempFile:off ;</span><span Class="bold">+notempfile</span> to <span Class="manpage">tempFile:on .)</span>

Use this option as a workaround when you encounter problems with the display of Type 1 fonts (but please don't forget to send a bug report in this case, to the URL mentioned in the section AUTHORS below). <br>(Note: <span Class="bold">-notype1fonts</span> corresponds to <span Class="manpage">type1:off ;</span><span Class="bold">+notype1fonts</span> to <span Class="manpage">type1:on .)</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-noxi2scrolling</span> 
<p class="level0">This will disable the use of high-resolution scrolling using the XInput 2.1 features of the X Server.  When enabled, horizontal and vertical scrolling is done in smaller increments than would correspond to a single click of a mouse wheel.  This is only available for hardware that supports the feature, generally touchpads.  It is not available for traditional wheel mice. If suitable hardware is not present or if the X server does not support XInput 2.1 or higher, then the high-resolution scrolling feature is turned off and has no effect. <br>(Note: <span Class="bold">-noxi2scrolling</span> corresponds to <span Class="manpage">xi2Scrolling:off ;</span>, <span Class="manpage">+noxi2scrolling</span>to <span Class="manpage">xi2Scrolling:on .)</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-offsets  dimen</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the size of both the horizontal and vertical offsets of the output on the page.  By decree of the Stanford *(Te Project, the default *(Te page origin is always 1 inch over and down from the top-left page corner, even when non-American paper sizes are used. Therefore, the default offsets are 1.0 inch. The argument <span Class="emphasis">dimen</span> should be a decimal number optionally followed by any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by *(Te

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p  pixels</span> 
<p class="level0">Defines the size of the fonts to use, in pixels per inch.  The default value is 600.  This option is provided only for backwards compatibility; the preferred way is to set both the resolution and the Metafont mode via the <span Class="bold">-mfmode</span> option (which see). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-paper  papertype</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the size of the printed page. Note that in most cases it's best to specify the paper size in the TeX input file via the line 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">\eusepackage[dvips]{geometry}</span> 
<p class="level0">which will be recognized by both dvips and xdvi; in that case the use of a `-paper' option should be unnecessary. <br>The paper size may be specified in the form <span class="emphasis">width<span class="bold">x<span Class="emphasis">height</span> optionally followed by a unit, where <span Class="emphasis">width</span> and <span Class="emphasis">height</span> are decimal numbers giving the width and height of the paper, respectively, and the unit is any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by *(Te 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">pc</span>, <span Class="manpage">in</span>, <span Class="manpage">bp</span>, <span Class="manpage">cm</span>, <span Class="manpage">mm</span>, <span Class="manpage">dd</span>, <span Class="manpage">cc</span>or <span Class="manpage">sp ).</span>By default, the unit is <span Class="manpage">cm  (centimeters)\fR.</span><br>There are also synonyms which may be used: <span Class="bold">us</span> (8.5x11in), <span Class="bold">legal</span> (8.5x14in), <span Class="bold">foolscap</span> (13.5x17in), as well as the ISO sizes <span Class="manpage">a1 - a7</span>, <span Class="manpage">b1 - b7</span>, <span Class="manpage">c1 - c7 .</span>Each of these also has a landscape or `rotated' variant: <span Class="bold">usr</span> (11x8.5in), <span Class="manpage">a1r - a7r</span>etc. For compatibility with <span Class="manpage">dvips</span>the formats <span Class="bold">letter</span> (8.5x11in), <span Class="bold">ledger</span> (17x11in) and <span Class="bold">tabloid</span> (11x17in) are also supported (these don't have rotated variants). <br>Any of the above sizes may be preceded by a plus sign 
<p class="level0">this causes the paper size given here to override any paper size given in the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file.  The default paper size is 21 x 29.7 cm (A4 size). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-pause</span> 
<p class="level0">This option provides a simple implementation of incremental (stepwise) display, which can be used for presentations. When this option is used, <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> will pause the display of the current page whenever it encounters a special <span Class="emphasis">special-string</span> 
<p class="level0">by default; the string can be customized via <span Class="emphasis">-pausespecial ,</span> see below), and the cursor will change its shape.  The action <span Class="bold">unpause-or-next()</span> (by default bound to the <span Class="bold">Space</span> key) will display the next portion of the page up to the following <span Class="emphasis">special-string ,</span> or until the end of the page is reached. When the option is not used, specials containing <span Class="emphasis">special-string</span> will be ignored. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-pausespecial  special-string</span> 
<p class="level0">Sets the special string that causes xdvi to pause when the <span Class="emphasis">-pause</span> option is active. The default value of <span Class="emphasis">special-string</span> is <span Class="emphasis">xdvi:pause .</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-postscript  flag</span> 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">flag = 0,</span> rendering of PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials is disabled; instead, bounding boxes will be displayed (if available). A value of <span Class="emphasis">1</span> (the default) switches PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials on. With a value of <span Class="emphasis">2 ,</span> the PostScript&lt;tm&gt; specials are displayed along with their bounding boxes; this allows you to visually check the correctness of the bounding boxes. The values can also be toggled at runtime with the 
<p class="level0">keystroke and the corresponding numerical prefix arguments 0, 1 and 2. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ps2pdfpath  path</span> 
<p class="level0">Use <span Class="emphasis">path</span> as a conversion program from PostScript to PDF. The program or script should accept two command-line arguments: The PostScript file as first argument, and the PDF output file as second argument. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-rulecolor  color</span> 
<p class="level0">Determines the color of the rules used for the the magnifier (default: foreground color). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-q</span> 
<p class="level0">Ignore the <span Class="emphasis">$HOME/.xdvirc</span> startup file (i.e. don't read it at startup, and don't write it at exit). This forces the defaults defined in <span Class="emphasis">$HOME/.Xdefaults</span> to be used.

<p class="level0">Same as <span Class="bold">-density</span> (which see). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s  shrink</span> 
<p class="level0">Defines the initial shrink factor.  The default value is 8.  If <span Class="emphasis">shrink</span> is given as 0, then the initial shrink factor is computed so that the page fits within the window (as if the `s' keystroke were given without a number). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-safer</span> 
<p class="level0">This option turns on all available security options; it is designed for use when <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> is called by a browser that obtains a <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> or *(Te file from another site. This option selects <span Class="bold">+nogssafer</span> and <span Class="manpage">+allowshell .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-sidemargin  dimen</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the side margin (see <span Class="manpage">-margins ).</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-sourceposition  line [: col ][ ] filename</span> This option makes <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> search in the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file for the place corresponding to the indicated line (and, optionally, column) in the .tex source file, and highlight the place found by drawing a rectangle in the <span Class="emphasis">highlight</span> color (see the <span Class="bold">-hl</span> option) around the corresponding text.  In addition, when run with this argument (and the <span Class="bold">-nofork</span> option is not given, which see), <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> will always return immediately:  if it finds another instance of <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> already showing <span Class="emphasis">dvi_file,</span> then it will cause that instance to raise its window and move to the given place in the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file; otherwise it will start up its own instance in the background. If several instances of xdvi are displaying the respective <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file, the instance which was last raised to the foreground will be used. 
<p class="level0">The space before <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> is only needed if the filename starts with a digit.  When the space is used, the argument needs to be enclosed in quotes to prevent the shell from misinterpreting the space as argument separator. 
<p class="level0">This option requires that <span Class="emphasis">dvi_file</span> be prepared with source special information.  See the section on SOURCE SPECIALS for details on how to do this. 
<p class="level0">Here is a more detailed description of how the filename in the <span Class="emphasis">-sourceposition</span> argument is matched with the filename in the source specials: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">1. If neither of the filenames contains a path name component, the filenames are compared ignoring the 
<p class="level1">extensions in both filenames. 
<p class="level1">2. Otherwise, if one of the filenames does contain a path component (e.g.: <span Class="emphasis">./test.tex ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">../test.tex ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">/my/homedir/tex/test.tex</span> or any combination of these), both filenames are expanded to a full path, with any occurrences of <span Class="emphasis">../</span> and <span Class="emphasis">./</span> expanded, and multiple slashes removed. <br>The pathname in the <span Class="emphasis">-sourceposition</span> is expanded relative to the current working directory of the <span Class="emphasis">xdvi -sourceposition</span> invocation, and the pathnames in the source specials are expanded relative to the path of the current DVI file being viewed. <br>The path names are then compared ignoring the 
<p class="level1">extensions in both path names. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-statusline</span> 
<p class="level0">This option is obsolete; use <span Class="bold">-expertmode </span> <span Class="emphasis">flag</span> instead (which see). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-text-encoding  encoding</span> 
<p class="level0">Use <span Class="emphasis">encoding</span> as the text encoding of the string in the "Find" window. Usually, this should not be needed since the encoding is determined from the locale settings. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-thorough</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> will usually try to ensure that overstrike characters (e.g., , <span Class="manpage">\enotin )</span>are printed correctly.  On monochrome displays, this is always possible with one logical operation, either <span Class="emphasis">and</span> or <span Class="emphasis">or .</span> On color displays, however, this may take two operations, one to set the appropriate bits and one to clear other bits.  If this is the case, then by default <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> will instead use the <span Class="emphasis">copy</span> operation, which does not handle overstriking correctly.  The <span Class="bold">-thorough</span> option chooses the slower but more correct choice.  See also <span Class="manpage">-copy .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-topmargin  dimen</span> 
<p class="level0">Specifies the top and bottom margins (see <span Class="manpage">-margins ).</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-unique</span> 
<p class="level0">This option will make another instance of xdvi running on the same display act as a `server'.  For example, the invocation 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">xdvi -unique +5 file.dvi</span> 
<p class="level0">will cause this other instance to load <span Class="emphasis">file.dvi</span> on page 5 in place of the file that it is currently displaying. If there is already another instance of xdvi already displaying the file <span Class="emphasis">file.dvi ,</span> then it will just jump to page 5. If the other instance of xdvi is displaying a different file, it will load <span Class="emphasis">file.dvi</span> instead. Otherwise, if no other instance of xdvi is currently running on the display, this option instead starts a new instance of xdvi in the background (unless the <span Class="emphasis">-nofork</span> option is specified, which see) displaying page 5 of <span Class="emphasis">file.dvi .</span> <br>The filename and the <span Class="bold">+n</span> option for the page number are the only options available for controlling a remote instance of xdvi like this; all other options are currently ignored. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-useTeXpages</span> Use logical *(Te pages (the values of the <span Class="emphasis">\ecount0</span> register) instead of physical pages for the pagelist labels and when jumping to a page in a document with the `g' keystroke (or the <span Class="bold">goto-page()</span> action).

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-watchfile  n</span> 
<p class="level0">If this option is set to a value larger than 0, xdvi will check the DVI file for changes every <span Class="emphasis">n</span> seconds. If the DVI file has been completely written by TeX, it will be reloaded automatically.  Fractional values (e.g. `2.5') are possible. The default for this option is 0, i.e. no watching. <br>Since xdvi cannot handle partial DVI files, it tries not to reload the file while it is being rewritten.  However, use of the magnifier or switching of pages requires reading (a part of) the DVI file, and if the <span Class="bold">tempfile</span> option is switched off, this will erase the current contents of the window until the DVI file can be read entirely. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-wheelunit  pixels</span> 
<p class="level0">Sets the number of pixels that a motion of a wheel mouse will move the image up, down, left, or right.

<p class="level0">Toggles fullscreen mode (see the description of the <span Class="bold">-fullscreen</span> option for more information on this). This is even more flaky than using the command-line option: There is no universal standard how a window could change its own geometry or window decorations at run-time, so this will not work with most window managers or desktops. Generally, it's better to use the window manager controls to change the size or decorations of the xdvi window.

<p class="level0">The mouse actions can be customized by setting the X resource <span Class="manpage">mouseTranslations .</span>Since there are three different mouse modes (see the section <a class="bold" href="#MODES">MODES</a> below), there is a special action <span Class="bold">mouse-modes</span> which lists the actions for each of the three modes: <span Class="bold">mouse-modes("ACTIONS-FOR-MODE1", "ACTIONS-FOR-MODE2", "ACTIONS-FOR-MODE3")</span>. If only one argument is specified, this action is used for all modes. The default bindings are as follows:

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">All of these actions are described in more detail below. Note the use of quote symbols around the action strings, which are necessary to group them into one argument. Buttons 4, 5, 6, and 7 refer to wheel movements (wheel up/down/left/right) on wheel mice.  Not all mice support horizontal scrolling. 
<p class="level0">The X Toolkit routines that implement translations do not support event types of <span Class="bold">Btn6Down</span> or <span Class="manpage">Btn7Down .</span>Because of this, <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> implements its own parser for translations given in <span Class="manpage">mouseTranslations .</span>This parser is more limited than the parser built in to the X Toolkit.

In this case, none of the other actions will be executed; otherwise, only the other actions are executed. <br>The action <span Class="bold">do-href()</span> jumps to the link target in the current xdvi window (eventually switching to another page), and <span Class="bold">do-href-newwindow()</span> opens a new instance of xdvi for the link target. In both cases, the location of the target is indicated by a small arrow drawn in the same color as a visited link in the left corner of the window. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">magnifier(n x m)</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">magnifier(*n)</span> This action will pop up a ``magnifying glass'' which shows the unshrunk image of the region around the mouse pointer.  The magnifier disappears when the mouse button is released. Moving the mouse cursor while holding the button down will move the magnifier. <br>Different mouse buttons produce different sized windows, as indicated by the the argument of the <span Class="emphasis">magnifier()</span> action. Its argument is either a string of the form <span Class="emphasis">width x height ,</span> as in the <span Class="bold">-mgs n</span> command-line option, or one of the strings <span Class="bold">*1</span> through <span Class="manpage">*5</span>referring to the value specified by the corresponding <span Class="bold">-mgs n</span> option.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">drag(+)</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">drag(|)</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">drag(-)</span> Drags the page with the mouse. This action should have one parameter, the character 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level0">indicating vertical dragging only, horizontal dragging only, or dragging in all directions. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">source-special()</span> This action starts a ``reverse search'', opening the editor at the location in the *(Te file corresponding to the pointer location in the DVI file. See the section on SOURCE SPECIALS, below, for more information on this. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">wheel()</span> This action can be used to scroll the image with a wheel mouse, where it is usually bound to mouse button 4 (wheel up) or 5 (wheel down). The action takes one parameter, giving the distance to scroll the image.  If the parameter contains a decimal point, the distance is given in wheel units; otherwise, pixels.  A negative value scrolls up, a positive value scrolls down. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">hwheel()</span> This action can be used to scroll the image horizontally with a wheel mouse, where it is usually bound to mouse button 6 (wheel left) or 7 (wheel right). The action takes one parameter, giving the distance to scroll the image.  If the parameter contains a decimal point, the distance is given in wheel units; otherwise, pixels.  A negative value scrolls left, a positive value scrolls right.  Not all mice support horizontal scrolling; this is mostly for touchpads, trackpads, etc. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">text-selection()</span> This action allows you to mark a rectangular region of text in the DVI file. The text is put into the X selection buffer and can be pasted into other applictions (e.g. text editors). This works similar to the Plain text option in the <span Class="bold">Save</span> dialog; see the discussion there for more information on encoding issues. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ruler()</span> This action creates a cross-shaped ruler. Moving the mouse and holding the button down drags the ruler and lets you measure distances on the page. See the section <span Class="bold">Ruler Mode</span> for more information on this. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="UNBOUND"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">UNBOUND ACTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The following actions are not bound to a key by default, but are available for customization. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">quit-confirm()</span> Pops up a confirmation window to quit xdvi. To bind it to the 
<p class="level0">key instead of the default `quit()' action, put the following into your <span Class="emphasis">~/.Xdefaults</span> file: 
<p class="level0">xdvi.mainTranslations: &#35;overridee <br>&lt;Key&gt;q: quit-confirm()en 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">down-or-next()</span> Similar to <span Class="emphasis">unpause-or-next() :</span> Moves down two-thirds of a window-full, or to the next page if already at the bottom of the page. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">shrink-to-dpi()</span> This action takes one (required) argument.  It sets the shrink factor to an integer so as to approximate the use of fonts with the corresponding number of dots per inch.  If <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> is using fonts scaled for <span Class="emphasis">p</span> dots per inch, and the argument to <span Class="bold">shrink-to-dpi</span> is <span Class="emphasis">n ,</span> then the corresponding shrink factor is the ratio <span Class="emphasis">p / n ,</span> rounded to the nearest integer. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="CUSTOMIZATION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CUSTOMIZATION</h2>
<p class="level0">Key and mouse button assignments can be changed by setting the <span Class="bold">mainTranslations</span> resource to a string of translations as defined in the documentation for the X toolkit.  The actions should take the form of action names listed in the KEYSTROKES and MOUSE ACTIONS sections. 
<p class="level0">An exception to this are the Motif keys <span Class="emphasis">osfPageUp  ( PgUp ),</span> <span Class="emphasis">osfPageDown  ( PgDown ),</span> <span Class="emphasis">osfBeginLine  ( Home )</span> and <span Class="emphasis">osfEndLine  ( End )</span> which are currently not customizable in the Motif version. 
<p class="level0">Key actions will usually be without arguments; if they are passed an argument, it represents the optional number or `prefix argument' typed prior to the action. 
<p class="level0">Some key actions may take special arguments, as follows: The argument of <span Class="bold">goto-page</span> may be the letter 
<p class="level0">indicating the action of going to the end of the document. The argument of <span Class="bold">set-shrink-factor</span> may be the letter 
<p class="level0">indicating that the shrink factor should be set to the smallest value such that the page will fit in the window, or one of the signs 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level0">indicating that the shrink factor should be increased or decreased, respectively. Finally, actions that would perform a toggle, such as <span Class="manpage">set-keep-flag</span>may receive an argument 
<p class="level0">indicating that the action should toggle regardless of the current prefix argument. 
<p class="level0">Mouse actions should refer only to <span Class="bold">ButtonPress</span> events (e.g., , <span Class="manpage">&lt;Btn1Down&gt;:magnifier(*1) ).</span>The corresponding motion and release events will be handled internally. A key action may be bound to a mouse event, but not vice versa. 
<p class="level0">Usually the string of translations should begin with 
<p class="level0">indicating that the default key and mouse button assignments should not be discarded. 
<p class="level0">When keys or mouse buttons involving modifiers (such as Ctrl or Shift) are customized together with their non-modified equivalents, the modified keys should come first, for example: 
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
xdvi.mainTranslations: &#35;override e
Shift&lt;Key&gt;s: select-dvi-file()ene
Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;s: save()ene
&lt;Key&gt;s: find()en
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Because <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> needs to capture pointer motion events, and because the X Toolkit translations mechanism cannot accommodate both motion events and double-click events at the same time, it is not possible to specify double-click actions in <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> customizations.  For information on this and other aspects of translations, see the X Toolkit Intrinsics documentation. 
<p class="level0">There is no command-line option to set the <span Class="bold">mainTranslations</span> resource, since changing this resource on the command line would be cumbersome. To set the resource for testing purposes, use the <span Class="bold">-xrm</span> command-line option provided by the X toolkit.  For example, <span Class="bold">xdvi -xrm 'XDvi.mainTranslations: &#35;override "z":quit()' ...</span> or <span Class="bold">xdvi -xrm 'XDvi.mainTranslations: #override &lt;Key&gt;z:quit()' ...</span> will cause the key 
<p class="level0">to quit <span Class="manpage">xdvi .</span>
<p class="level0">Some resources are provided to allow customization of the geometry of the Xaw command buttons.  Again, they are not changeable via command-line options, other than via the <span Class="bold">-xrm</span> option.  All of these resources take integer values. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">buttonSideSpacing</span> The number of pixels to be placed on either side of the buttons. The default value is 6. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">buttonTopSpacing</span> The number of pixels between the top button and the top of the window. The default value is 50. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">buttonBetweenSpacing</span> The number of pixels between the buttons. The default value is 20. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">buttonBetweenExtra</span> The number of pixels of additional space to be inserted if the <span Class="bold">buttonTranslations</span> resource string contains an extra newline character. The default value is 50. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">buttonBorderWidth</span> The border width of the button windows.  The default value is 1. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="PAGE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PAGE LIST</h2>
<p class="level0">The scrollable page list on the right of the main window allows you to jump directly to a page in the DVI file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Mouse-1</span> Jumps to the page the mouse is located on. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Mouse-2</span> 
<p class="level0">Toggle the mark of the current page. The marks are used by the `Print' and `Save to file' dialogs to select only marked pages from the DVI file. 
<p class="level0">When the mouse pointer is inside the page list, the mouse wheel switches to the next or previous page. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="SCROLLBARS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SCROLLBARS</h2>
<p class="level0">The scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard way:  pushing Button 2 in a scrollbar moves the top or left edge of the scrollbar to that point and optionally drags it; pushing Button 1 moves the image up or right by an amount equal to the distance from the button press to the upper left-hand corner of the window; pushing Button 3 moves the image down or left by the same amount. 
<p class="level0">The scrollbars can be removed via the <span Class="emphasis">-expertmode</span> flag/keystroke (which see). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="MAGNIFIER"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">MAGNIFIER</h2>
<p class="level0">By default, the mouse buttons 1 to 5 will pop up a ``magnifying glass'' that shows an unshrunken image of the page (i.e. an image at the resolution determined by the option/X resource <span Class="bold">pixels</span> or <span Class="manpage">mfmode )</span>at varying sizes. When the magnifier is moved, small ruler-like tick marks are displayed at the edges of the magnifier (unless the X resource <span Class="bold">delayRulers</span> is set to false, in which case the tick marks will always be displayed). The unit of the marks is determined by the X resource <span Class="bold">tickUnits</span> (mm by default). This unit can be changed at runtime via the action <span Class="manpage">switch-magnifier-units()</span>by default bound to the keystroke 
<p class="level0">(see the description of that key, and of switch-magnifier-units() for more details on the units available). <br>The length of the tick marks can be changed via the X resource <span Class="bold">tickLength</span> (4 by default). A zero or negative value suppresses the tick marks. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="PAGE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PAGE HISTORY</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> keeps a history of viewed pages, and you can move through the history and delete items using the keys <span Class="bold">[</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">]</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Ctr-[</span> 
<p class="level0">and <span Class="bold">Ctr-]</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When one of the history commands is used, the page history is displayed in the status line at the bottom of the window, with the current list item marked by square brackets `[', `]' and a left and right context of at most 10 items. File boundaries are marked by `&#35;'. 
<p class="level0">The size of the history can be customized with the X resource <span Class="bold">pageHistorySize</span> (the default size is 1000 items). If the size is set to 0, the history commands are disabled. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="HYPERLINKS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">HYPERLINKS</h2>
<p class="level0">The actions <span Class="bold">do-href()</span> and <span Class="bold">do-href-newwindow()</span> (by default bound to Mouse-1 and Mouse-2 if the pointer is currently located on a hyperlink) can be used to open the link target in the same window 
<p class="level0">or in a new window 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If the link target is not a file on the local disk, xdvi tries to launch a web browser (as specified by the <span Class="bold">-browser</span> command line option, the <span Class="bold">BROWSER</span> environment variable or the <span Class="bold">wwwBrowser</span> X resource, in this order) to retrieve the document. See the description of the <span Class="bold">BROWSER</span> environment variable, below, for an example setting. 
<p class="level0">If the file is a local file, xdvi tries to determine if it is a DVI file. If it is, xdvi will try to display the file; otherwise it will try to determine the MIME type of the file, and from that an application suitable for opening the file. This is done by parsing the files specified by the environment variable <span Class="bold">EXTENSIONMAPS</span> for a mapping of filename extensions to MIME types, and the files determined by the environment variable <span Class="bold">MAILCAPS</span> for a mapping of MIME types to application programs. See the descriptions of these variables in the section <a class="manpage" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a>below, for a more detailed description and the default values of these variables. If no suitable files are found, a set of built-in default MIME types and applications is used. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> currently uses no heuristics apart from the filename suffix to determine the mime type of a file. If a filename has no suffix, the value of the resource <span Class="bold">noMimeSuffix</span> is used (by default <span Class="emphasis">application/x-unknown ).</span> If the suffix doesn't match any of the suffixes in <span Class="manpage">mime.types</span>the value of the resource <span Class="bold">unknownMimeSuffix</span> is used (by default <span Class="emphasis">application/x-unknown ).</span> If the <span Class="bold">mailcap</span> entries do not list a viewer for a given mime type, xdvi will show a warning popup. If you want to avoid this warning, and for example want to always use the netscape browser for unknown MIME types, you could add the following line to your ~/.mailcap file: 
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
application/xdvi-unknown; e
&nbsp;   netscape -raise -remote 'openURL(%s,new-window)'
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="STRING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">STRING SEARCH</h2>
<p class="level0">The keystroke <span Class="emphasis">Ctrl-f</span> or the menu entry <span Class="emphasis">File &gt; Find ...</span> (or the `Binoculars' symbol in the toolbar, for Motif) opens a dialog window to search for a text string or a regular expression in the DVI file. The keystroke <span Class="emphasis">Ctrl-g</span> jumps to the next match (like pressing the `Find' button in the search window). 
<p class="level0">By default, the matches are highlighted in inverted color. If the display isn't running in TrueColor, or if the X resource <span Class="bold">matchHighlightInverted</span> is set to false or the command-line option <span Class="bold">-nomatchinverted</span> is used, xdvi will instead draw a rectangle in <span Class="emphasis">highlight</span> color (see the <span Class="bold">-hl</span> option) around the match. 
<p class="level0">If a match crosses a page boundary, only the part on the first page is highlighted. <span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> will scan up to 2 adjacent pages to match strings crossing page boundaries; but note that header or footer lines, or intervening float pages will be treated as parts of the scanned text. Such text will usually cause multi-page matching to fail. 
<p class="level0">This emphasizes the fact that searching in the formatted text (the DVI output) works differently from searching in the source text: Searching in the DVI file makes it easier to skip formatting instructions, and makes it possible to search for e.g. hyphenation and equation numbers; but sometimes the formatting results can also get in the way, e.g. in the case of footnotes. In these cases it's better to search in the *(Te source instead. The use of <span Class="emphasis">source specials</span> will make switching between the xdvi display and the editor with the *(Te source easier; see the section <a class="bold" href="#SOURCE">SOURCE SPECIALS</a> below for more information on this. 
<p class="level0">The text extracted from the DVI file is in encoded in UTF-8 (you can view that text by saving the file in UTF-8 format via the <span Class="emphasis">File &gt; Save as ...</span> menu item). If xdvi has been compiled with locale, <span Class="emphasis">nl_langinfo()</span> and <span Class="emphasis">iconv</span> support, the search term is converted from the character set specified by the current locale into UTF-8. (See the output of <span Class="bold">locale -a</span> for a list of locale settings available on your system). If <span Class="emphasis">nl_langinfo()</span> is not available, but <span Class="emphasis">iconv</span> is, you can specify the input encoding for <span Class="emphasis">iconv</span> via the X resource <span Class="emphasis">textEncoding</span> (see the output of <span Class="bold">iconv -l</span> for a list of valid encodings). If <span Class="emphasis">iconv</span> support is not available, only the encodings <span Class="emphasis">ISO-8859-1</span> and <span Class="emphasis">UTF-8</span> are supported (these names are case-insensitive). 
<p class="level0">Ideographic characters from CJKV fonts are treated specially: All white space (spaces and newlines) before and after such characters is ignored in the search string and in the DVI file. 
<p class="level0">To match a newline character, use <span Class="emphasis">en</span> in the search string; to match the string <span Class="emphasis">en</span>, use <span Class="emphasis">een</span>. 
<p class="level0">If the checkbox <span Class="emphasis">Regular Expression</span> is activated, the string is treated as a regular expression in extended POSIX syntax, with the following properties: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">- <span Class="emphasis">a?</span> matches <span Class="emphasis">a</span> zero or one times. 
<p class="level1">- <span Class="emphasis">a*</span> matches <span Class="emphasis">a</span> zero or more times. 
<p class="level1">- <span Class="emphasis">a+</span> matches <span Class="emphasis">a</span> one or more times. Note that <span Class="emphasis">*</span> and <span Class="emphasis">+</span> are greedy, i.e. they match the longest possible substring. 
<p class="level1">- The pattern <span Class="emphasis">.</span> matches any character except for newline. To also match a newline, use `<span Class="emphasis">(.|en)</span>'. 
<p class="level1">- <span Class="emphasis">a{n}</span> matches <span Class="emphasis">a</span> exactly n times. 
<p class="level1">- <span Class="emphasis">a{n,m}</span> matches <span Class="emphasis">a</span> at least n and no more than m times. 
<p class="level1">- <span Class="emphasis">a|b</span> matches <span Class="emphasis">a</span> or <span Class="emphasis">b</span>. Brackets can be used for grouping, e.g.: <span Class="emphasis">(a|b)|c</span>. 
<p class="level1">- The string matched by the nth group can be referenced by <span Class="emphasis">en</span>, e.g. <span Class="emphasis">e1</span> refers to the first match. 
<p class="level1">- The characters <span Class="emphasis">^</span> and <span Class="emphasis">$</span> match the beginning and the end of a line, respectively. 
<p class="level1">- <span Class="emphasis">[abc]</span> matches any of the letters a, b, c, and <span Class="emphasis">[a-z]</span> matches all characters from a to z. 
<p class="level1">- Each item in a regular expression can also be one of the following POSIX character classes: <br><pre class="level1">
<span class="emphasis">[[:alnum:]] [[:alpha:]] [[:blank:]] [[:cntrl:]] [[:digit:]]</span> <span class="emphasis">[[:graph:]] [[:lower:]] [[:print:]] [[:space:]] [[:upper:]]</span> </pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">These can be negated by inserting a <span Class="emphasis">^</span> symbol after the first bracket: <span Class="emphasis">[^[:alpha:]]</span> 
<p class="level1">For more details on POSIX regular expressions, see e.g. the <span Class="bold">IEEE Std 1003.1</span> standard definition available online from: 
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">- As a non-standard extension, the following Perl-like abbreviations can be used instead of the POSIX classes: <pre class="level1">
Symbol	Meaning	POSIX Class
&nbsp;
&nbsp;   <span class="emphasis">ew</span>	an alphanumeric character	<span class="emphasis">[[:alnum:]]</span>
&nbsp;   <span class="emphasis">eW</span>	a non-alphanumeric character	<span class="emphasis">[^[:alnum:]]</span>
&nbsp;   <span class="emphasis">ed</span>	a digit character	<span class="emphasis">[[:digit:]]</span>

&nbsp;   <span class="emphasis">es</span>	a whitespace character	<span class="emphasis">[[:space:]]</span>
&nbsp;   <span class="emphasis">eS</span>	a non-whitespace character	<span class="emphasis">[^[:space:]]</span>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">- The following characters are special symbols; they need to be escaped with <span Class="emphasis">e</span> in order to match them literally: <span Class="emphasis"> ( ) [ ] . * ? + ^ $ e</span>. 
<p class="level1">- Matches of length zero are silently skipped. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The dialog also provides checkboxes to: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">- search backwards; 
<p class="level1">- match in a case-sensitive manner (the default is to ignore case, i.e. a search string <span Class="emphasis">Test</span> will match both the strings <span Class="emphasis">test</span> and <span Class="emphasis">TEST</span> in the DVI file); 
<p class="level1">- ignore line breaks and hyphens: This removes all hyphens at the ends of lines and the following newline characters, and replaces all remaining newline characters by white spaces. So hyphenated words will appear as one word to the search, and a search for two words with a space in between will also match the words if they are separated by a linebreak. <br>Note that the hyphen removal may cause unwanted side effects for compound words containing hyphens that are wrapped after the hyphen, and that replacing the newlines affects the interpretation of regular expressions as follows: The <span Class="emphasis">.</span> pattern will also match newlines, and <span Class="emphasis">^</span> and <span Class="emphasis">$</span> won't match begin and end of lines any more. (Since currently there is no option for turning off the greediness of <span Class="emphasis">*</span> and <span Class="emphasis">+</span>, turning on this option will usually result in matches that are longer than desired.) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The current checkbox settings are saved in the <span Class="emphasis">~/.xdvirc</span> file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="PRINT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PRINT DIALOG</h2>
<p class="level0">The print dialog window allows you to print all pages, marked pages (click or drag Mouse-2 in the page list to mark them), or a range of pages. Note that the page numbers always refer to physical pages, so if you're using the option `use TeX pages', you may want to disable it to make it easier to determine the correct page numbers (or avoid this problem altogether by marking the pages to be printed). 
<p class="level0">The value of the <span Class="bold">Printer</span> text filed is passed to <span Class="bold">dvips</span> via the <span Class="bold">-o!</span> mechanism, as a single argument after the `!'. Any arguments listed in the <span Class="bold">Dvips options</span> field are segmented at whitespaces and passed as separate arguments to dvips. If you e.g. want to print the file 2-up, you should enter the following string into the <span Class="bold">Printer</span> field: 
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
&nbsp;   <span class="emphasis">psnup -2 -q | lpr -Plp</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">There are several resources for customizing the behaviour and the default entries of the print dialog: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dvipsPrinterString</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dvipsOptionsString</span> These can be used to provide default entries for the <span Class="bold">Printer</span> and the <span Class="bold">Dvips options</span> text fields, respectively. If no paper size is specified in the DVI file (via e.g. eusepackage[dvips]{geometry} - this is the preferred method), the input field is initialized with the current value of the command line option/X resource <span Class="manpage">paper .</span>E.g., the option <span Class="emphasis">-paper a4r</span> is translated into the dvips options <span Class="emphasis">-t a4 -t landscape .</span> Note that no check is performed whether dvips actually understands these options (it will ignore them if it can't); currently not all options used by xdvi are also covered by dvips. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dvipsHangTime</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dvipsFailHangTime</span> These specify the time (in milliseconds) that the printing progress window will stay open after the <span Class="bold">dvips</span> process has terminated. The value of <span Class="manpage">dvipsHangTime</span>is used if the process terminates successfully; <span Class="bold">dvipsFailHangTime</span> is used if it terminates with an error. The default values are 1.5 and 5 seconds, respectively. If both values are negative, the window will stay open until it is closed by the user. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="SAVE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SAVE DIALOG</h2>
<p class="level0">This dialog allows you to save all or selected/marked pages in the current DVI file. You can save in one of the following formats: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">- PostScript (uses <span Class="bold">dvips</span> to convert the DVI file to a PostScript file, just like when printing to a PostScript file). 
<p class="level1">- PDF (first uses <span Class="bold">dvips</span> to convert the DVI file to a PostScript file, then uses <span Class="bold">ps2pdf</span> to convert the PostScript file to PDF). 
<p class="level1">- Plain text in ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8 encoding. The latter will preserve more of the special LaTeX characters e.g. from mathematical mode. Note however that e.g. only few of LaTeX's mathematical symbols can be rendered correctly as text; so this funcionality works best for plain text documents. If a character cannot be displayed in the selected charset, it is replaced by `e' followed by the hexadecimal character code. If a character is not recognized at all, it is replaced by `?'. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The programs for PostScript and PDF conversion can be customized via the command line options or X resources <span Class="manpage">-dvipspath / .dvipsPath</span>and <span Class="manpage">-ps2pdfpath / .ps2pdfPath</span>respectively; see the explanation of these options above for more details.

<p class="level0">The keystroke <span Class="bold">Ctrl-m</span> [<span Class="bold">switch-mode()</span>] switches between three different mouse bindings, which can also be activated via the <span Class="bold">Modes</span> menu (in Motif, this is a submenu of the <span Class="bold">Options</span> menu called <span Class="manpage">Mouse Mode ).</span>The default mode at startup can be customized via the X resource <span Class="bold">mouseMode</span> or the command-line option <span Class="manpage">-mousemode .</span>The default startup mode is Magnifier Mode. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Note:</span> The modes are implemented by changing the <span Class="emphasis">magnifier()</span> action. Switching the mode will not work if <span Class="bold">Mouse-1</span> has been customized to an action sequence that does not contain the magnifier() action. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Magnifier Mode</span> In this mode, the mouse buttons 1 to 5 pop up a ``magnifying glass'' that shows an unshrunken image of the page (i.e. an image at the resolution determined by the option/X resource <span Class="bold">pixels</span> or <span Class="manpage">mfmode )</span>at varying sizes. When the magnifier is moved, small ruler-like tick marks are displayed at the edges of the magnifier (unless the X resource <span Class="bold">delayRulers</span> is set to false, in which case the tick marks are always displayed). The unit of the marks is determined by the X resource <span Class="bold">tickUnits</span> (mm by default). This unit can be changed at runtime via the action <span Class="manpage">switch-magnifier-units()</span>by default bound to the keystroke 
<p class="level0">(see the description of that key, and of switch-magnifier-units() for more details on the units available). <br>The length of the tick marks can be changed via the X resource <span Class="bold">tickLength</span> (4 by default). A zero or negative value suppresses the tick marks. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Text Selection Mode</span> This mode allows you to select a rectangular region of text in the DVI file by holding down <span Class="bold">Mouse-1</span> and moving the mouse. The text is put into the X primary selection so that it can be pasted into other X applications with <span Class="bold">Mouse-2</span> as usual. <br>If xdvi has been compiled with locale, <span Class="emphasis">nl_langinfo()</span> and <span Class="emphasis">iconv</span> support, the selected text is converted into the character set of the current locale (see the output of <span Class="bold">locale -a</span> for a list of locale settings available on your system). If <span Class="emphasis">nl_langinfo()</span> is not available, but <span Class="emphasis">iconv</span> is, you can specify the input encoding for <span Class="emphasis">iconv</span> via the X resource <span Class="emphasis">textEncoding</span> (see the output of <span Class="bold">iconv -l</span> for a list of valid encodings). If <span Class="emphasis">iconv</span> support is not available, only the encodings <span Class="emphasis">ISO-8859-1</span> and <span Class="emphasis">UTF-8</span> are supported (these names are case-insensitive). <br>Note that UTF-8 is the only encoding that can render all characters (e.g. mathematical symbols) of a DVI file. If ISO-8859-1 is active, characters that cannot be displayed are replaced by `e' followed by the hexadecimal character code. For other encodings, such characters may trigger iconv error messages. If a character is not recognized at all, it is replaced by `?'. <br>To extract larger portions of text, you can alternatively save selected pages or the entire file in text format via the <span Class="bold">File &gt; Save as ...</span> menu. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Ruler Mode</span> This mode provides a simple way of measuring distances on the page. <br>When this mode is activated, the mouse cursor changes into a thin cross, and a larger, cross-shaped ruler is drawn in the highlight color at the mouse location. The ruler doesn't have units attached to it; instead, the current distance between the ruler and the mouse cursor is continuously printed to the statusline. <br>When activating Ruler Mode, the ruler is at first attached to the mouse and can be moved around. It can then be positioned at a fixed place by clicking <span Class="manpage">Mouse-1 .</span>After that, the mouse cursor can be moved to measure the horizontal 
<p class="level0">vertical 
<p class="level0">and direct (shortest) 
<p class="level0">distance between the ruler center point and the mouse. <br>Clicking <span Class="bold">Mouse-1</span> again will move the ruler to the current mouse position, and holding down <span Class="bold">Mouse-1</span> will drag the ruler around. <br>In Ruler Mode, the following special keybindings extend or replace the default bindings: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">o</span> 
<p class="level1">Snap the ruler back to the origin coordinate (0,0). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">t</span> </span>[overrides <span Class="bold">switch-magnifier-units()</span>] Toggle between various ruler units, which can be specified by the X resource <span Class="bold">tickUnits</span> (`mm' by default). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">P</span> </span>[overrides <span Class="bold">declare-page-number()</span>] Print the distances shown in the statusline to standard output. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="TOOLBAR"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">TOOLBAR (Motif only)</h2>
<p class="level0">The Motif toolbar can also be customized. The XPM file used for the toolbar icons can be specified via the resource <span Class="manpage">toolbarPixmapFile</span>which should contain a filename that can be found in one of <span Class="bold">XFILESEARCHPATH</span> or <span Class="bold">XDVIINPUTS</span> (see the section <span Class="bold">FILE SEARCHING</span> below for more information on these variables). <span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> will try to split this pixmap horizontally into <span Class="emphasis">n</span> pieces, where each piece is as wide as the pixmap is high and is treated as an image for toolbar button <span Class="emphasis">n .</span> This means that each icon should be a square, and that the entire pixmap should have width <span Class="emphasis">n</span> x <span Class="emphasis">h</span> if <span Class="emphasis">h</span> is the height of the pixmap. 
<p class="level0">The resource <span Class="bold">toolbarTranslations</span> can be used to map icons/buttons to specific actions. The resource should contain a string separated by newline characters, similar to the resources <span Class="bold">mainTranslations</span> and <span Class="manpage">menuTranslations .</span>Every line must contain either a spacer definition, or an icon definition: 
<p class="level0">A spacer definition is a string <span class="bold">SPACER(<span class="emphasis">n<span Class="bold">)</span>, where <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is the number of pixels inserted as separator to the following button. 
<p class="level0">An icon definition is a colon-separated list containing the following elements:

<p class="level0"><a name="GREYSCALING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS</h2>
<p class="level0">The greyscale anti-aliasing feature in <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> will not work at its best if the display does not have enough colors available. This can happen if other applications are using most of the colormap (even if they are iconified).  If this occurs, then <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> will print an error message and turn on the <span Class="bold">-copy</span> option.  This will result in overstrike characters appearing wrong; it may also result in poor display quality if the number of available colors is very small. 
<p class="level0">Typically this problem occurs on displays that allocate eight bits of video memory per pixel.  To see how many bits per pixel your display uses, type <span Class="bold">xwininfo</span> in an <span Class="bold">xterm</span> window, and then click the mouse on the root window when asked.  The ``Depth:'' entry will tell you how many bits are allocated per pixel. 
<p class="level0">Displays using at least 15 bits per pixel are typically <span Class="bold">TrueColor</span> visuals, which do not have this problem, since their colormap is permanently allocated and available to all applications.  (The visual class is also displayed by <span Class="manpage">xwininfo .)</span>For more information on visual classes see the documentation for the X Window System. 
<p class="level0">To alleviate this problem, therefore, one may (a) run with more bits per pixel (this may require adding more video memory or replacing the video card), (b) shut down other applications that may be using much of the colormap and then restart <span Class="manpage">xdvi</span>or (c) run <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> with the <span Class="bold">-install</span> option. 
<p class="level0">One application which is often the cause of this problem is <span Class="manpage">Netscape .</span>In this case there are two more alternatives to remedying the situation. One can run 
<p class="level0">to cause <span Class="bold">Netscape</span> to install a private colormap.  This can cause colors to change in bizarre ways when the mouse is moved to a different window. Or, one can run 
<p class="level0">to limit <span Class="bold">Netscape</span> to a smaller number of colors.  A smaller number will ensure that other applications have more colors available, but will degrade the color quality in the <span Class="bold">Netscape</span> window. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="HANDLING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">HANDLING OF POSTSCRIPT FIGURES</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Xdvi</span> can display Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files included in the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file.  Such files are first searched for in the directory where the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file is, and then using normal <span Class="bold">Kpathsea</span> rules.  There is an exception to this, however:  if the file name begins with a backtick 
<p class="level0">then the remaining characters in the file name give a shell command (often <span Class="manpage">zcat )</span>which is executed; its standard output is then sent to be interpreted as PostScript. Since the execution of arbitrary shell commands with the user's permissions is a huge security risk, evaluation of these backtick commands is disabled by default. It needs to be activated via the <span Class="bold">-allowshell</span> command-line option. <span Class="bold">NOTE:</span> You should never use this option when viewing documents that you didn't compile yourself. The backtick specials are not needed for uncompressing gzipped PostScript files, since <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> can do that on the fly if the filename ends with <span Class="emphasis">.eps.gz</span> or <span Class="emphasis">.eps.Z</span> (and if the first bytes of the file indicate that the file is indeed compressed).  This is both safer and more flexible than the backtick approach, since the default file searching rules will apply to such filenames too. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="TYPE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">TYPE 1 FONTS</h2>
<p class="level0">Using FreeType (version 2), <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> can render PostScript&lt;tm&gt; Type 1 fonts directly, without the route via *(Te pixel (pk) fonts. The advantage of this is that only one size of each font needs to be stored on disk. Unless the <span Class="bold">-notype1fonts</span> option is used, <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> will try to render every font using FreeType. Only as a fallback will it invoke an external program (like <span Class="manpage">mktexpk</span>which in turn may invoke utilities like <span Class="bold">ps2pk</span> or <span Class="manpage">gsftopk )</span>to generate a pixel font from the Type 1 source. The direct rendering of the <span Class="bold">Computer Modern</span> fonts should work out-of-the box, whereas other Type 1 fonts such as the 35 `standard' PostScript&lt;tm&gt; fonts resident in printers may need to be made accessible for use with <span Class="manpage">xdvi</span>unless your system administrator or TeX distribution has already done so (which is the case e.g. for current TeX Live systems). For the 35 PostScript&lt;tm&gt; resident fonts, <span Class="bold">xdvik</span> will search using the <span Class="bold">Fontmap</span> provided with <span Class="manpage">Ghostscript</span>if necessary.  Also, the <span Class="bold">xdvik</span> distribution comes with a utility called <span Class="bold">t1mapper</span> to make these fonts available for xdvi; see the manual page for t1mapper(1) for usage details.  This program is likely to be dropped in the future, however, since it is probably not needed anymore. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="SPECIALS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SPECIALS (GENERALLY)</h2>
<p class="level0">Any of the specials used by <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> may be preceded by the characters 
<p class="level0">Doing so does not change the behavior of the special under <span Class="manpage">xdvi</span>but it tells other dvi drivers (such as e.g. dvips) to ignore the special. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="SOURCE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SOURCE SPECIALS</h2>
<p class="level0">Some *(Te implementations or macro packages provide the facility to automatically include so-called `source specials' into a DVI file. These contain the line number, eventually a column number, and the filename of the .tex source. This makes it possible to jump from a .dvi file to the corresponding place in the .tex source and vice versa (also called `inverse search' - jumping from the DVI file to the TeX file is also known as `reverse search', and jumping from the TeX file to the DVI file as `forward search'). 
<p class="level0">To be usable with <span Class="manpage">xdvi</span>source specials in the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file must have one of the following formats: 
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
&nbsp;   <span class="bold">src:</span><span class="emphasis">line</span>[ ]<span class="emphasis">filename</span>
&nbsp;   <span class="bold">src:</span><span class="emphasis">line</span><span class="bold">:</span><span class="emphasis">col</span>[ ]<span class="emphasis">filename</span>
&nbsp;   <span class="bold">src:</span><span class="emphasis">line</span>
&nbsp;   <span class="bold">src:</span><span class="emphasis">line</span><span class="bold">:</span><span class="emphasis">col</span>
&nbsp;   <span class="bold">src::</span><span class="emphasis">col</span>
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> or <span Class="emphasis">line</span> are omitted, the most recent values are used.  The first source special on each page must be in one of the first two forms, since defaults are not inherited across pages. 
<p class="level0">You will need a *(Te implementation that provides an appropriate switch (e.g. <span Class="emphasis">-src )</span> or a macro package (such as <span Class="emphasis">srcltx.sty</span> or <span Class="emphasis">srctex.sty ,</span> available from CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported/srcltx/) to insert such source specials into the DVI file. 
<p class="level0">For reverse search, the combination <span Class="emphasis">Ctrl-Mouse 1</span> will make xdvi open an editor (the value of the <span Class="emphasis">-editor</span> command line option) with the file and the line number of the .tex source. See the description of the <span Class="emphasis">-editor</span> option for more information and example settings. 
<p class="level0">For forward search, <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> has a <span Class="emphasis">-sourceposition</span> option that makes <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> jump to the page in the DVI file corresponding to the given line (or the closest line having a source special) of the specified file and highlight the found region. See the description of the <span Class="emphasis">-sourceposition</span> option for more details.

&nbsp;   <span class="bold">papersize=</span>[<span class="bold">*</span>]<span class="emphasis">width</span>,<span class="emphasis">height</span>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">where <span Class="emphasis">width</span> and <span Class="emphasis">height</span> give the width and height of the paper, respectively.  Each of these should appear in the form of a decimal number followed by any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by *(Te 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">pc</span>, <span Class="manpage">in</span>, <span Class="manpage">bp</span>, <span Class="manpage">cm</span>, <span Class="manpage">mm</span>, <span Class="manpage">dd</span>, <span Class="manpage">cc</span>or <span Class="manpage">sp ).</span>If an asterisk 
<p class="level0">appears just before the width, then the measurements refer to the document dimensions (e.g., <span Class="bold">pt</span> as opposed to <span Class="manpage">truept ).</span>This allows a macro package to vary the page size according to elements of the document; e.g., 
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
especial{xdvi: papersize=*enumberewdemybox sp,
&nbsp;        enumberehtemybox sp}

<p class="level0">Except for the asterisk, this format is compatible with <span Class="manpage">dvips .</span>
<p class="level0">The last <span Class="bold">papersize</span> special on a page determines the size of that page.  If there is no such special on a given page, the most recent <span Class="bold">papersize</span> is used, or, if there are no <span Class="bold">papersize</span> specials on any preceding page, then the value of the <span Class="bold">paper</span> resource (or <span Class="bold">-paper</span> option on the command line) is used.  Thus the paper size may vary for different pages of the <span Class="emphasis">dvi</span> file. 
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="bold">paper</span> resource (or <span Class="bold">-paper</span> command-line option) begins with a plus sign

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">test= command</span> The entry is only used if <span Class="emphasis">command</span> can be executed via the <span Class="bold">system()</span> call and if the system() call returns with value 0 (success). The <span Class="emphasis">command</span> string may contain the format string <span Class="emphasis">%s ,</span> which will be replaced by the file name. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">needsterminal</span> If this flag is used, the command will be executed in a new xterm window by prepending 
<p class="level1">to the command string. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">All other fields in the mailcap entry are ignored by xdvi. Earlier entries in one of these files override later ones. If the variable is not defined, the following default path is used: 
<p class="level2"><pre class="level2">
$HOME/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:e
&nbsp;   /usr/local/etc/mailcap
</pre>

<p class="level2">
<p class="level1"><br>For security reasons, some special characters (i.e.: ( ) ` e ;) are escaped in the argument before passing it to , <span Class="manpage">system() .</span>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Determines the web browser used to open external links (i.e., all URLs that don't start with the 
<p class="level0">scheme and are not relative links in the local DVI file), and to open links for which no viewer has been specified in the <span Class="bold">mailcap</span> files. The value of this variable is a colon-separated list of commands. Xdvi will try each of them in sequence until one succeeds (i.e. doesn't immediately return with status 0). This allows you to specify your favourite browser at the beginning, and fallback browsers at the end. Every occurrence of <span Class="emphasis">%s</span> in the string is replaced by the target URL; every occurrence of <span Class="emphasis">%%</span> is replaced by a single <span Class="emphasis">% .</span> If no <span Class="emphasis">%s</span> is present, the URL string is added as an extra argument. <br>An example setting is:

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A colon-separated list of directories to search for <span Class="bold">Fontmap</span> files, etc., as used for Ghostscript.  It has the same meaning as it does when running Ghostscript.  In <span Class="manpage">xdvik</span>it is used when searching for font files when the map file does not give a file name for the font (this should be quite rare).  The command <span Class="bold">gs -h</span> will list the default value that Ghostscript uses.  See also the 
<p class="level0">environment variable (below). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This has the same effect as 
<p class="level0">but affects only <span Class="manpage">xdvi .</span>Use this when you want to use a different value for 
<p class="level0">when running <span Class="manpage">xdvi</span>but use either the compiled-in default value or some other value when running Ghostscript.  If both 
<p class="level0">and 
<p class="level0">are set, then <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> uses 
<p class="level0">To use the default value compiled in to <span Class="bold">xdvi</span> while still retaining the ability to set 
<p class="level0">for use with Ghostscript, you can set 
<p class="level0">to the empty string. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The directory to use for storing temporary files created when uncompressing PostScript files. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Determines the editor command used for source special `reverse search', if neither the <span Class="emphasis">-editor</span> command-line option nor the <span Class="emphasis">.editor</span> resource are  specified.   See  the description of the <span Class="emphasis">-editor</span> command line option for details on the format. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Determines an editor to be opened in an xterm window if neither of <span Class="emphasis">-editor ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">.editor ,</span> or <span Class="emphasis">XEDITOR</span> is specified. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Determines an editor to be opened in an xterm window if neither of <span Class="emphasis">-editor ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">.editor ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">XEDITOR</span> or <span Class="emphasis">VISUAL</span> is specified.

<p class="level0"><a name="LIMITATIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">LIMITATIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">xdvi</span> accepts many but not all types of PostScript specials accepted by , <span Class="manpage">dvips .</span>For example, it accepts most specials generated by <span Class="bold">epsf</span> and <span Class="manpage">psfig .</span>It does not, however, support <span Class="bold">bop-hook</span> or <span Class="manpage">eop-hook</span>nor does it allow PostScript commands to affect the rendering of things that are not PostScript (for example, the ``NEAT'' and rotated ``A'' examples in the <span Class="bold">dvips</span> manual).  These restrictions are due to the design of <span Class="manpage">xdvi ;</span>in all likelihood they will always remain. 
<p class="level0">La*(Te2e rotation specials are currently not supported. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">MetaPost</span> files containing included text are not supported. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">Xdvi 's</span>color handling doesn't support the <span Class="bold">\ecolorbox</span> and <span Class="bold">\efcolorbox</span> macros;  this is not likely to change in the near future. This also means that e.g. colored tables (as created by the <span Class="emphasis">colortbl</span> package) may render incorrectly: Text in colors different from the default foreground color may not be displayed. When the page is redrawn (e.g. after using the magnifier), the background color of the cells may overdraw the text. <a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">An optional configuration file for the Type 1 font setup, which specifies <span Class="manpage">dvips -style</span>map files specific to <span Class="manpage">xdvik .</span>If used, it should be present in the directory determined by the <span Class="bold">TEXCONFIG</span> environment variable.
