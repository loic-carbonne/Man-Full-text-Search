<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">Run the *(TX typesetter on <span Class="emphasis">file ,</span> usually creating <span Class="emphasis">file.dvi .</span> If the file argument has no extension, ".tex" will be appended to it.  Instead of a filename, a set of *(TX commands can be given, the first of which must start with a backslash. With a  <span Class="bold">& format</span> argument *(TX uses a different set of precompiled commands, contained in <span Class="emphasis">format\fB.fmt\fP ;</span> it is usually better to use the <span Class="bold">-fmt</span> <span Class="emphasis">format</span> option instead. 
<p class="level0">*(TX formats the interspersed text and commands contained in the named files and outputs a typesetter independent file (called <span Class="emphasis">DVI ,</span> which is short for <span Class="emphasis">DeVice Independent ).</span> *(TX's capabilities and language are described in <span Class="emphasis">The \*(OXbook .</span> *(TX is normally used with a large body of precompiled macros, and there are several specific formatting systems, such as *(LX, which require the support of several macro files. 
<p class="level0">This version of *(TX looks at its command line to see what name it was called under.  If they exist, then both <span Class="bold">initex</span> and <span Class="bold">virtex</span> are symbolic links to the <span Class="bold">tex</span> executable.  When called as <span Class="manpage">initex</span>(or when the <span Class="bold">-ini</span> option is given) it can be used to precompile macros into a <span Class="emphasis">.fmt</span> file.  When called as <span Class="bold">virtex</span> it will use the <span Class="emphasis">plain</span> format.  When called under any other name, *(TX will use that name as the name of the format to use.  For example, when called as <span Class="bold">tex</span> the <span Class="emphasis">tex</span> format is used, which is identical to the <span Class="emphasis">plain</span> format.  The commands defined by the <span Class="emphasis">plain</span> format are documented in <span Class="emphasis">The \*(OXbook .</span> Other formats that are often available include <span Class="emphasis">latex</span> and <span Class="emphasis">amstex .</span> 
<p class="level0">The non-option command line arguments to the *(TX program are passed to it as the first input line.  (But it is often easier to type extended arguments as the first input line, since UNIX shells tend to gobble up or misinterpret *(TX's favorite symbols, like backslashes, unless you quote them.) As described in <span Class="emphasis">The \*(OXbook ,</span> that first line should begin with a filename, a <span Class="emphasis">\econtrolsequence ,</span> or a <span Class="emphasis">&formatname .</span> 
<p class="level0">The normal usage is to say 
<p class="level0">tex paper 
<p class="level0">to start processing <span Class="emphasis">paper.tex .</span> The name <span Class="emphasis">paper</span> will be the ``jobname'', and is used in forming output filenames. If *(TX doesn't get a filename in the first line, the jobname is <span Class="emphasis">texput .</span> When looking for a file, *(TX looks for the name with and without the default extension 
<p class="level0">appended, unless the name already contains that extension.  If <span Class="emphasis">paper</span> is the ``jobname'', a log of error messages, with rather more detail than normally appears on the screen, will appear in <span Class="emphasis">paper.log ,</span> and the output file will be in <span Class="emphasis">paper.dvi .</span> 
<p class="level0">This version of *(TX can look in the first line of the file <span Class="emphasis">paper.tex</span> to see if it begins with the magic sequence <span Class="emphasis">%& .</span> If the first line begins with <span Class="bold">%& format</span> <span Class="bold">-translate-file \ tcxname</span> then *(TX will use the named format and translation table <span Class="emphasis">tcxname</span> to process the source file.  Either the format name or the <span Class="bold">-translate-file</span> specification may be omitted, but not both.  This overrides the format selection based on the name by which the program is invoked. The <span Class="bold">-parse-first-line</span> option or the <span Class="bold">parse_first_line</span> configuration variable controls whether this behaviour is enabled. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">e</span> response to *(TX's error prompt causes the system default editor to start up at the current line of the current file.  The environment variable TEXEDIT can be used to change the editor used.  It may contain a string with "%s" indicating where the filename goes and "%d" indicating where the decimal line number (if any) goes.  For example, a TEXEDIT string for <span Class="bold">emacs</span> can be set with the <span Class="bold">sh</span> command 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">TEXEDIT="emacs +%d %s"; export TEXEDIT</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A convenient file in the library is <span Class="emphasis">null.tex ,</span> containing nothing. When *(TX can't find a file it thinks you want to input, it keeps asking you for another filename; responding `null' gets you out of the loop if you don't want to input anything.  You can also type your EOF character (usually control-D). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">This version of *(TX understands the following command line options. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-enc</span> Enable the enc*(TX extensions.  This option is only effective in combination with <span Class="manpage">-ini .</span>For documentation of the enc*(TX extensions see <span Class="manpage">http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-file-line-error</span> Print error messages in the form <span Class="emphasis">file:line:error</span> which is similar to the way many compilers format them. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-file-line-error</span> Disable printing error messages in the <span Class="emphasis">file:line:error</span> style. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-file-line-error-style</span> This is the old name of the <span Class="bold">-file-line-error</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-fmt \ format</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">format</span> as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which *(TX was called or a <span Class="emphasis">%&</span> line. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-halt-on-error</span> Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during processing. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-help</span> Print help message and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ini</span> Start in <span Class="emphasis">INI</span> mode, which is used to dump formats.  The <span Class="emphasis">INI</span> mode can be used for typesetting, but no format is preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes may be required. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-interaction \ mode</span> Sets the interaction mode.  The mode can be either <span Class="emphasis">batchmode ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">nonstopmode ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">scrollmode ,</span> and <span Class="emphasis">errorstopmode .</span> The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding ecommands. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ipc</span> Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output file.  Whether this option is available is the choice of the installer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ipc-start</span> As <span Class="manpage">-ipc</span>and starts the server at the other end as well.  Whether this option is available is the choice of the installer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-jobname \ name</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">name</span> for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-kpathsea-debug \ bitmask</span> Sets path searching debugging flags according to the bitmask.  See the <span Class="emphasis">Kpathsea</span> manual for details. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-mktex \ fmt</span> Enable 
<p class="level0">where <span Class="emphasis">fmt</span> must be either <span Class="emphasis">tex</span> or <span Class="emphasis">tfm .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-mltex</span> Enable ML*(TX extensions.  Only effective in combination with <span Class="manpage">-ini .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-mktex \ fmt</span> Disable 
<p class="level0">where <span Class="emphasis">fmt</span> must be either <span Class="emphasis">tex</span> or <span Class="emphasis">tfm .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-output-comment \ string</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">string</span> for the <span Class="emphasis">DVI</span> file comment instead of the date. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-output-directory \ directory</span> Write output files in <span Class="emphasis">directory</span> instead of the current directory.  Look up input files in <span Class="emphasis">directory</span> first, then along the normal search path.  See also description of the TEXMFOUTPUT environment variable. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-parse-first-line</span> If the first line of the main input file begins with <span Class="emphasis">%&</span> parse it to look for a dump name or a <span Class="bold">-translate-file</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-parse-first-line</span> Disable parsing of the first line of the main input file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-progname \ name</span> Pretend to be program <span Class="emphasis">name .</span> This affects both the format used and the search paths. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-recorder</span> Enable the filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened for input and output in a file with extension <span Class="emphasis">.fls .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-shell-escape</span> Enable the <span Class="bold">\ewrite18{ command }</span> construct.  The <span Class="emphasis">command</span> can be any shell command.  This construct is normally disallowed for security reasons. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-shell-escape</span> Disable the <span Class="bold">\ewrite18{ command }</span> construct, even if it is enabled in the <span Class="emphasis">texmf.cnf</span> file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-src-specials</span> Insert source specials into the <span Class="emphasis">DVI</span> file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-src-specials \ where</span> Insert source specials in certain places of the <span Class="emphasis">DVI</span> file. <span Class="emphasis">where</span> is a comma-separated value list: <span Class="emphasis">cr ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">display ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">hbox ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">math ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">par ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">parent ,</span> or <span Class="emphasis">vbox .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-translate-file \ tcxname</span> Use the <span Class="emphasis">tcxname</span> translation table to set the mapping of input characters and re-mapping of output characters. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-default-translate-file \ tcxname</span> Like <span Class="bold">-translate-file</span> except that a <span Class="emphasis">%&</span> line can overrule this setting. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-version</span> Print version information and exit. 
<p class="level0"><a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the `Path specifications' node) for precise details of how the environment variables are used. The <span Class="bold">kpsewhich</span> utility can be used to query the values of the variables. 
<p class="level0">One caveat: In most *(TX formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to *(TX, because ~ is an active character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other programs, such as *(MF, do not have this problem. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXMFOUTPUT</span> Normally, *(TX puts its output files in the current directory.  If any output file cannot be opened there, it tries to open it in the directory specified in the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT. There is no default value for that variable.  For example, if you say <span Class="emphasis">tex paper</span> and the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has the value <span Class="emphasis">/tmp ,</span> *(TX attempts to create <span Class="emphasis">/tmp/paper.log</span> (and <span Class="emphasis">/tmp/paper.dvi ,</span> if any output is produced.)  TEXMFOUTPUT is also checked for input files, as *(TX often generates files that need to be subsequently read; for input, no suffixes (such as ``.tex'') are added by default, the input name is simply checked as given. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXINPUTS</span> Search path for <span Class="emphasis">\einput</span> and <span Class="emphasis">\eopenin</span> files. This probably start with ``.'', so that user files are found before system files.  An empty path component will be replaced with the paths defined in the <span Class="emphasis">texmf.cnf</span> file.  For example, set TEXINPUTS to ".:/home/user/tex:" to prepend the current directory and ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXFORMATS</span> Search path for format files. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXPOOL</span> search path for <span Class="bold">tex</span> internal strings. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXEDIT</span> Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually <span Class="manpage">vi</span>is set when *(TX is compiled. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TFMFONTS</span> Search path for font metric 
<p class="level0">files. 
<p class="level0"><a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>
<p class="level0">The location of the files mentioned below varies from system to system.  Use the <span Class="bold">kpsewhich</span> utility to find their locations. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">texmf.cnf</span> Configuration file.  This contains definitions of search paths as well as other configuration parameters like <span Class="manpage">parse_first_line .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">tex.pool</span> Text file containing *(TX's internal strings. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">texfonts.map</span> Filename mapping definitions. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">*.tfm</span> Metric files for *(TX's fonts. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">*.fmt</span> Predigested *(TX format (.|fmt) files. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">$TEXMFMAIN/tex/plain/base/plain.tex</span> The basic macro package described in the *(OXbook. <br>

<p class="level0"><a name="BUGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">BUGS</h2>
<p class="level0">This version of *(TX implements a number of optional extensions. In fact, many of these extensions conflict to a greater or lesser extent with the definition of *(TX.  When such extensions are enabled, the banner printed when *(TX starts is changed to print <span Class="bold">TeXk</span> instead of <span Class="manpage">TeX .</span>
<p class="level0">This version of *(TX fails to trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are added or subtracted.  Cases where this occurs are rare, but when it does the generated <span Class="emphasis">DVI</span> file will be invalid.
