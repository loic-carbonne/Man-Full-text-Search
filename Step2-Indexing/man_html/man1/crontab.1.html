<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">crontab</span> is the program used to install, deinstall or list the tables used to drive the <span Class="emphasis">cron (8)</span> daemon in Vixie Cron.  Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly. 
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="emphasis">/etc/cron.allow</span> file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command.  If the <span Class="emphasis">/etc/cron.allow</span> file does not exist but the <span Class="emphasis">/etc/cron.deny</span> file does exist, then you must <span Class="bold">not</span> be listed in the <span Class="emphasis">/etc/cron.deny</span> file in order to use this command.  
<p class="level0">If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command.  
<p class="level0">If both files exist then  <span Class="emphasis">/etc/cron.allow</span> takes precedence. Which means that  <span Class="emphasis">/etc/cron.deny</span> is not considered and your user must be listed in  <span Class="emphasis">/etc/cron.allow</span> in order to be able to use the crontab. 
<p class="level0">Regardless of the existance of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab.  For standard Debian systems, all users may use this command. 
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="emphasis">-u</span> option is given, it specifies the name of the user whose crontab is to be used (when listing) or modified (when editing). If this option is not given, <span Class="emphasis">crontab</span> examines "your" crontab, i.e., the crontab of the person executing the command.  Note that <span Class="emphasis">su (8)</span> can confuse <span Class="emphasis">crontab</span> and that if you are running inside of <span Class="emphasis">su (8) </span> you should always use the <span Class="emphasis">-u</span> option for safety's sake. 
<p class="level0">The first form of this command is used to install a new crontab from some named file or standard input if the pseudo-filename ``-'' is given. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">-l</span> option causes the current crontab to be displayed on standard output. See the note under  <a class="bold" href="#DEBIAN">DEBIAN SPECIFIC</a> below. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">-r</span> option causes the current crontab to be removed. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">-e</span> option is used to edit the current crontab using the editor specified by the s-1VISUALs+1 or s-1EDITORs+1 environment variables. After you exit from the editor, the modified crontab will be installed automatically. If neither of the environment variables is defined, then the default editor /usr/bin/editor is used. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">-i</span> option modifies the -r option to prompt the user for a 'y/Y' response before actually removing the crontab. <a name="DEBIAN"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DEBIAN SPECIFIC</h2>
<p class="level0">The "out-of-the-box" behaviour for <span Class="emphasis">crontab -l</span> is to display the three line "DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE" header  that is placed at the beginning of the crontab when it is installed. The problem is that it makes the sequence 
<p class="level0">crontab -l | crontab - 
<p class="level0">non-idempotent -- you keep adding copies of the header. This causes pain to scripts that use sed to edit a crontab. Therefore, the default behaviour of the  <span Class="bold">-l</span> option has been changed to not output such header. You may obtain the original behaviour by setting the environment variable  <span Class="bold">CRONTAB_NOHEADER</span> to 'N', which will cause the <span Class="emphasis">crontab -l</span> command to emit the extraneous header. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>

<p class="level0">There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the <span Class="emphasis">crontab</span> group and configuring <span Class="emphasis">crontab</span> command with the setgid bid set for that specific group. <a name="STANDARDS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">STANDARDS</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">crontab</span> command conforms to IEEE Std1003.2-1992 (``POSIX'').  This new command syntax differs from previous versions of Vixie Cron, as well as from the classic SVR3 syntax.

<p class="level0">A fairly informative usage message appears if you run it with a bad command line. 
<p class="level0">cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character. If the last entry in a crontab is missing the newline, cron will consider the crontab (at least partially) broken and refuse to install it.
