<p class="level0">xscreensaver - extensible screen saver and screen locking framework <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">xscreensaver</span> [-display <span Class="emphasis">host:display.screen</span>] \ [-verbose] \ [-no-splash] \ [-no-capture-stderr] \ [-log <span Class="emphasis">filename</span>] <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> program waits until the keyboard and mouse have been  idle for a period, and then runs a graphics demo chosen at random.  It  turns off as soon as there is any mouse or keyboard activity. 
<p class="level0">This program can lock your terminal in order to prevent others from using it, though its default mode of operation is merely to display pretty pictures on your screen when it is not in use. 
<p class="level0">It also provides configuration and control of your monitor's power-saving features. <a name="GETTING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">GETTING STARTED</h2>
<p class="level0">For the impatient, try this: 
<p class="level0">xscreensaver & xscreensaver-demo 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>program pops up a dialog box that lets you configure the screen saver, and experiment with the various display modes. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Note that xscreensaver has a client-server model:</span> the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> program is a daemon that runs in the background; it is controlled by the foreground <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>and <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-command (1)</span>programs. <a name="CONFIGURATION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CONFIGURATION</h2>
<p class="level0">The easiest way to configure <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> is to simply run the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>program, and change the settings through the GUI.  The rest of this manual page describes lower level ways of changing settings. 
<p class="level0">I'll repeat that because it's important: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">The easy way to configure xscreensaver is to run the  <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>program.  You shouldn't need to know any of the stuff described  in <span Class="emphasis">this</span> manual unless you are trying to do something tricky, like customize xscreensaver for site-wide use or something. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Options to <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> are stored in one of two places: in  a <span Class="emphasis">.xscreensaver</span> file in your home directory; or in the X resource database.  If the <span Class="emphasis">.xscreensaver</span> file exists, it overrides any settings in the resource database.   
<p class="level0">The syntax of the <span Class="emphasis">.xscreensaver</span> file is similar to that of the <span Class="emphasis">.Xdefaults</span> file; for example, to set the <span Class="emphasis">timeout</span> parameter in the <span Class="emphasis">.xscreensaver</span> file, you would write the following: 
<p class="level0">timeout: 5 
<p class="level0">whereas, in the <span Class="emphasis">.Xdefaults</span> file, you would write 
<p class="level0">xscreensaver.timeout: 5 
<p class="level0">If you change a setting in the <span Class="emphasis">.xscreensaver</span> file while xscreensaver is already running, it will notice this, and reload the file.  (The file will be reloaded the next time the screen saver needs to take some action, such as blanking or unblanking the screen, or picking a new graphics mode.) 
<p class="level0">If you change a setting in your X resource database, or if you want xscreensaver to notice your changes immediately instead of the next time it wakes up, then you will need to reload your <span Class="emphasis">.Xdefaults</span> file, and then tell the running xscreensaver process to restart itself, like so: 
<p class="level0">xrdb &lt; ~/.Xdefaults xscreensaver-command -restart 
<p class="level0">If you want to set the system-wide defaults, then make your edits to the xscreensaver app-defaults file, which should have been installed when xscreensaver itself was installed.  The app-defaults file will usually be named /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver, but different systems might keep it in a different place (for example, /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/XScreenSaver on Solaris.) 
<p class="level0">When settings are changed in the Preferences dialog box (see above) the current settings will be written to the <span Class="emphasis">.xscreensaver</span> file. (The <span Class="emphasis">.Xdefaults</span> file and the app-defaults file will never be written by xscreensaver itself.) <a name="COMMAND-LINE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> also accepts a few command-line options, mostly for use when debugging: for normal operation, you should configure things via the <span Class="emphasis">~/.xscreensaver</span> file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-display host:display.screen</span> The X display to use.  For displays with multiple screens, XScreenSaver will manage all screens on the display simultaniously. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-verbose</span> Same as setting the <span Class="emphasis">verbose</span> resource to <span Class="emphasis">true</span>: print diagnostics on stderr and on the xscreensaver window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-capture-stderr</span> Do not redirect the stdout and stderr streams to the xscreensaver window itself.  If xscreensaver is crashing, you might need to do this in order to see the error message. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-log filename</span> This is exactly the same as redirecting stdout and stderr to the given file (for append).  This is useful when reporting bugs. <a name="HOW"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p class="level0">When it is time to activate the screensaver, a full-screen black window is created on each screen of the display.  Each window is created in such a way that, to any subsequently-created programs, it will appear to be a "virtual root" window.  Because of this, any program which draws on the root  window (and which understands virtual roots) can be used as a screensaver. The various graphics demos are, in fact, just standalone programs that know how to draw on the provided window. 
<p class="level0">When the user becomes active again, the screensaver windows are unmapped, and the running subprocesses are killed by sending them <span Class="bold">SIGTERM</span>.  This is  also how the subprocesses are killed when the screensaver decides that it's time to run a different demo: the old one is killed and a new one is launched. 
<p class="level0">You can control a running screensaver process by using the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-command (1)</span>program (which see.) <a name="POWER"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">POWER MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">Modern X servers contain support to power down the monitor after an idle period.  If the monitor has powered down, then <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> will notice this (after a few minutes), and will not waste CPU by drawing  graphics demos on a black screen.  An attempt will also be made to explicitly power the monitor back up as soon as user activity is detected. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">~/.xscreensaver</span> file controls the configuration of your display's power management settings: if you have used <span Class="manpage">xset (1)</span>to change your power management settings, then xscreensaver will override those changes with the values specified  in <span Class="emphasis">~/.xscreensaver</span> (or with its built-in defaults, if there is no <span Class="emphasis">~/.xscreensaver</span> file yet.) 
<p class="level0">To change your power management settings, run <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>and change the various timeouts through the user interface. Alternately, you can edit the <span Class="emphasis">~/.xscreensaver</span> file directly. 
<p class="level0">If the power management section is grayed out in the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>window,  then that means that your X server does not support the XDPMS extension, and so control over the monitor's power state is not available. 
<p class="level0">If you're using a laptop, don't be surprised if changing the DPMS settings has no effect: many laptops have monitor power-saving behavior built in at a very low level that is invisible to Unix and X.  On such systems, you can typically adjust the power-saving delays only by changing settings in the BIOS in some hardware-specific way. 
<p class="level0">If DPMS seems not to be working with XFree86, make sure the "DPMS" option is set in your <span Class="emphasis">/etc/X11/XF86Config</span> file.  See the <span Class="manpage">XF86Config (5)</span>manual for details. <a name="USING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USING GNOME</h2>
<p class="level0">For the better part of a decade, GNOME shipped xscreensaver as-is, and everything just worked out of the box.  In 2005, however, they decided to re-invent the wheel and ship their own replacement for the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> daemon called "<span Class="emphasis">gnome-screensaver</span>", rather than improving xscreensaver and contributing their changes back.  As a result, the "<span Class="emphasis">gnome-screensaver</span>" program is insecure, bug-ridden, and missing many features of xscreensaver.  You shouldn't use it. 
<p class="level0">To replace gnome-screensaver with xscreensaver: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">1: Fully uninstall the gnome-screensaver package.</span> 
<p class="level1">sudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">2: Launch xscreensaver at login.</span> Select "<span Class="emphasis">Startup Applications</span>" from the menu (or manually launch "<span Class="emphasis">gnome-session-properties</span>") and add "<span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span>". 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">3: Make "Lock Screen" use xscreensaver.</span> 
<p class="level1">sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command \ &nbsp;           /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command 
<p class="level1"><a name="USING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USING KDE</h2>
<p class="level0">Like GNOME, KDE also decided to invent their own screen saver framework from scratch instead of simply using xscreensaver.  To replace the KDE screen saver with xscreensaver, do the following: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">1: Turn off KDE's screen saver.</span> Open the "<span Class="emphasis">Control Center</span>" and select the "<span Class="emphasis">Appearance & Themes / Screensaver</span>" page. Un-check "<span Class="emphasis">Start Automatically</span>". 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">2: Find your Autostart directory.</span> Open the "<span Class="emphasis">System Administration / Paths</span>" page, and see what your "Autostart path" is set to: it will probably be <span Class="emphasis">~/.kde/Autostart/</span> or something similar. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">3: Make xscreensaver be an Autostart program.</span> Create a .desktop file in your autostart directory  called <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver.desktop</span> that contains the following five lines: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">[Desktop Entry] Exec=xscreensaver Name=XScreenSaver Type=Application X-KDE-StartupNotify=false 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">4: Make the various "lock session" buttons call xscreensaver.</span> The file you want to replace next has moved around over the years. It might be called <span Class="emphasis">/usr/libexec/kde4/kscreenlocker</span>, or it might be called "<span Class="emphasis">kdesktop_lock</span>" or "<span Class="emphasis">krunner_lock</span>" or "<span Class="emphasis">kscreenlocker_greet</span>", and it might be in <span Class="emphasis">/usr/lib/kde4/libexec/</span> or in <span Class="emphasis">/usr/kde/3.5/bin/</span> or even in <span Class="emphasis">/usr/bin/</span>, depending on the distro and phase of the moon.  Replace the contents of that file with these two lines: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&#35;!/bin/sh xscreensaver-command -lock 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Make sure the file is executable (chmod a+x). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Now use xscreensaver normally, controlling it via the usual <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>and <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-command (1)</span>mechanisms. <a name="USING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USING UNITY</h2>
<p class="level0">Guess what, they did it again!  Ubuntu Unity's screen-locking framework is <span Class="emphasis">yet another</span> rewrite, and it is completely broken, bug-ridden and insecure. At this time I don't have any information on how to turn it off and use xscreensaver instead.  If you do, let me know. <a name="USING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USING GDM</h2>
<p class="level0">You can run <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> from your  <span Class="manpage">gdm (1)</span>session, so that the screensaver will run even when nobody is logged  in on the console.  To do this, run <span Class="manpage">gdmconfig (1)</span>and on the <span Class="emphasis">Background</span> page, type the  command <span Class="bold">"xscreensaver -nosplash"</span> into the <span Class="emphasis">Background Program</span> field.  That will cause gdm to run xscreensaver while nobody is logged in, and kill it as soon as someone does log in.  (The user will then be responsible for starting xscreensaver on their own, if they want.) 
<p class="level0">Another way to accomplish the same thing is to edit the file <span Class="emphasis">/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf</span> to include: 
<p class="level0">BackgroundProgram=xscreensaver -nosplash RunBackgroundProgramAlways=true 
<p class="level0">In this situation, the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> process will probably be running as user <span Class="emphasis">gdm</span> instead of <span Class="emphasis">root</span>.  You can configure the settings for this nobody-logged-in state (timeouts, DPMS, etc.) by editing the <span Class="emphasis">~gdm/.xscreensaver</span> file. 
<p class="level0">To get gdm to run the BackgroundProgram, you may need to switch it from the "Graphical Greeter" to the "Standard Greeter". 
<p class="level0">It is safe to run <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> as root (as <span Class="emphasis">xdm</span> or <span Class="emphasis">gdm</span> may do.) If run as root, <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> changes its effective user and group ids  to something safe (like <span Class="emphasis">"nobody"</span>) before connecting to the X server or launching user-specified programs. 
<p class="level0">An unfortunate side effect of this (important) security precaution is that it may conflict with cookie-based authentication. 
<p class="level0">If you get "connection refused" errors when running <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> from <span Class="emphasis">gdm</span>, then this probably means that you have <span Class="manpage">xauth (1)</span>or some other security mechanism turned on.  For information on the X server's access control mechanisms, see the man pages for <a class="manpage" href="#X">X (1)</a>, <span Class="manpage">Xsecurity (1)</span>, <span Class="manpage">xauth (1)</span>and <span Class="manpage">xhost (1).</span><a name="BUGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">BUGS</h2>
<p class="level0">Bugs?  There are no bugs.  Ok, well, maybe.  If you find one, please let me know.  <a href="http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/bugs.html">http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/bugs.html</a> explains how to construct the most useful bug reports. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Locking and root logins</span> In order for it to be safe for xscreensaver to be launched by <span Class="emphasis">xdm</span>, certain precautions had to be taken, among them that xscreensaver never runs as <span Class="emphasis">root</span>.  In particular, if it is launched as root (as <span Class="emphasis">xdm</span> is likely to do), xscreensaver will disavow its privileges, and switch  itself to a safe user id (such as <span Class="emphasis">nobody</span>.) 
<p class="level0">An implication of this is that if you log in as <span Class="emphasis">root</span> on the console,  xscreensaver will refuse to lock the screen (because it can't tell the difference between <span Class="emphasis">root</span> being logged in on the console, and a normal user being logged in on the console but xscreensaver having been  launched by the <span Class="manpage">xdm (1)</span><span Class="emphasis">Xsetup</span> file.) 
<p class="level0">The solution to this is simple: you shouldn't be logging in on the console as <span Class="emphasis">root</span> in the first place!  (What, are you crazy or something?)   
<p class="level0">Proper Unix hygiene dictates that you should log in as yourself, and <span Class="manpage">su (1)</span>to <span Class="emphasis">root</span> as necessary.  People who spend their day logged in as <span Class="emphasis">root</span> are just begging for disaster. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">XAUTH and XDM</span> For xscreensaver to work when launched by , <span Class="manpage">xdm (1)</span>or <span Class="manpage">gdm (1)</span>programs running on the local machine as user <span Class="emphasis">"nobody"</span> must be able to connect to the X server.  This means that if you want to run xscreensaver on the console while nobody is logged in, you may need to disable cookie-based access control (and allow all users who can log in to the local machine to connect to the display.)   
<p class="level0">You should be sure that this is an acceptable thing to do in your environment before doing it.  See the "<span Class="emphasis">Using GDM</span>" section,  above, for more details. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Passwords</span> If you get an error message at startup like "couldn't get password of <span Class="emphasis">user</span>" then this probably means that you're on a system in which  the , <span Class="manpage">getpwent (3)</span>library routine can only be effectively used by root.  If this is the case,  then <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> must be installed as setuid to root in order for locking to work.  Care has been taken to make this a safe thing to do.   
<p class="level0">It also may mean that your system uses shadow passwords instead of the standard <span Class="manpage">getpwent (3)</span>interface; in that case, you may need to change some options  with <span Class="emphasis">configure</span> and recompile. 
<p class="level0">If you change your password after xscreensaver has been launched, it will continue using your old password to unlock the screen until xscreensaver is restarted.  On some systems, it may accept <span Class="emphasis">both</span> your old and new passwords.  So, after you change your password, you'll have to do 
<p class="level0">xscreensaver-command -restart 
<p class="level0">to make <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> notice. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PAM Passwords</span> If your system uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules), then in order for xscreensaver to use PAM properly, PAM must be told about xscreensaver. The xscreensaver installation process should update the PAM data (on Linux, by creating the file <span Class="emphasis">/etc/pam.d/xscreensaver</span> for you, and on Solaris,  by telling you what lines to add to the <span Class="emphasis">/etc/pam.conf</span> file.)   
<p class="level0">If the PAM configuration files do not know about xscreensaver, then  you <span Class="emphasis">might</span> be in a situation where xscreensaver will refuse to ever unlock the screen. 
<p class="level0">This is a design flaw in PAM (there is no way for a client to tell the difference between PAM responding "I have never heard of your module", and responding, "you typed the wrong password".)  As far as I can tell, there is no way for xscreensaver to automatically work around this, or detect the problem in advance, so if you have PAM, make sure it is configured correctly! 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Machine Load</span> Although this program "nices" the subprocesses that it starts,  graphics-intensive subprograms can still overload the machine by causing the X server process itself (which is not "niced") to consume many cycles.  Care has been taken in all the modules shipped with xscreensaver to sleep periodically, and not run full tilt, so as not to cause appreciable load. 
<p class="level0">However, if you are running the OpenGL-based screen savers on a machine that does not have a video card with 3D acceleration, they <span Class="emphasis">will</span> make your machine slow, despite <span Class="manpage">nice (1).</span>
<p class="level0">Your options are: don't use the OpenGL display modes; or, collect the spare change hidden under the cushions of your couch, and use it to buy a video card manufactured after 1998.  (It doesn't even need to be <span Class="emphasis">fast</span> 3D hardware: the problem will be fixed if there is any 3D hardware <span Class="emphasis">at all.</span>) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">XFree86's Magic Keystrokes</span> The XFree86 X server traps certain magic keystrokes before client programs ever see them.  Two that are of note are Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, which causes  the X server to exit; and Ctrl+Alt+F<span Class="emphasis">n</span>, which switches virtual consoles. The X server will respond to these keystrokes even if xscreensaver has the screen locked.  Depending on your setup, you might consider this a problem. 
<p class="level0">Unfortunately, there is no way for xscreensaver itself to override the interpretation of these keys.  If you want to disable Ctrl+Alt+Backspace globally, you need to set the <span Class="emphasis">DontZap</span> flag in  your <span Class="emphasis">/etc/X11/XF86Config</span> file.  To globally disable VT switching, you can set the <span Class="emphasis">DontVTSwitch</span> flag.  See the <span Class="manpage">XF86Config (5)</span>manual for details. <a name="X"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">X RESOURCES</h2>
<p class="level0">These are the X resources use by the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> program. You probably won't need to change these manually (that's what the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>program is for). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">timeout (class \fBTime)</span> The screensaver will activate (blank the screen) after the keyboard and mouse have been idle for this many minutes.  Default 10 minutes. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">cycle (class \fBTime)</span> After the screensaver has been running for this many minutes, the currently running graphics-hack sub-process will be killed (with <span Class="bold">SIGTERM</span>), and a new one started.  If this is 0, then the graphics hack will never be changed: only one demo will run until the screensaver is deactivated by user activity. Default 10 minutes. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">lock (class \fBBoolean)</span> Enable locking: before the screensaver will turn off, it will require you  to type the password of the logged-in user (really, the person who ran xscreensaver), or the root password.  (<span Class="bold">Note:</span> this doesn't work if the screensaver is launched by <span Class="manpage">xdm (1)</span>because it can't know the user-id of the logged-in user.  See  the "<span Class="emphasis">Using XDM(1)</span>" section, below. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">lockTimeout (class \fBTime)</span> If locking is enabled, this controls the length of the "grace period" between when the screensaver activates, and when the screen becomes locked. For example, if this is 5, and <span Class="emphasis">-timeout</span> is 10, then after 10 minutes, the screen would blank.  If there was user activity at 12 minutes, no password would be required to un-blank the screen.  But, if there was user activity at 15 minutes or later (that is, <span Class="emphasis">-lock-timeout</span> minutes after  activation) then a password would be required.  The default is 0, meaning that if locking is enabled, then a password will be required as soon as the  screen blanks. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">passwdTimeout (class \fBTime)</span> If the screen is locked, then this is how many seconds the password dialog box should be left on the screen before giving up (default 30 seconds.)  This should not be too large: the X server is grabbed for the duration that the password dialog box is up (for security purposes) and leaving the server  grabbed for too long can cause problems. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dpmsEnabled (class \fBBoolean)</span> Whether power management is enabled. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dpmsStandby (class \fBTime)</span> If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor goes solid black. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dpmsSuspend (class \fBTime)</span> If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor goes into power-saving mode. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dpmsOff (class \fBTime)</span> If power management is enabled, how long until the monitor powers down completely.  Note that these settings will have no effect unless both the X server and the display hardware support power management; not  all do.  See the <span Class="emphasis">Power Management</span> section, below, for more  information. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dpmsQuickOff (class \fBBoolean)</span> If <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> is <span Class="emphasis">blank</span> and this is true, then the screen will be powered down immediately upon blanking, regardless of other power-management settings. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">visualID (class \fBVisualID)</span> Specify which X visual to use by default.  (Note carefully that this resource is called <span Class="bold">visualID</span>, not merely <span Class="bold">visual</span>; if you set the <span Class="bold">visual</span> resource instead, things will malfunction in obscure ways for obscure reasons.) 
<p class="level0">Legal values for the <span Class="bold">VisualID</span> resource are: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">default</span> Use the screen's default visual (the visual of the root window.)   This is the default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">best</span> Use the visual which supports the most colors.  Note, however, that the visual with the most colors might be a TrueColor visual, which does not support colormap animation.  Some programs have more interesting behavior when run on PseudoColor visuals than on TrueColor. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">mono</span> Use a monochrome visual, if there is one. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">gray</span> Use a grayscale or staticgray visual, if there is one and it has more than one plane (that is, it's not monochrome.) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">color</span> Use the best of the color visuals, if there are any. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">GL</span> Use the visual that is best for OpenGL programs.  (OpenGL programs have somewhat different requirements than other X programs.) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">class</span> where <span Class="emphasis">class</span> is one of <span Class="bold">StaticGray</span>, <span Class="bold">StaticColor</span>,  <span Class="bold">TrueColor</span>, <span Class="bold">GrayScale</span>, <span Class="bold">PseudoColor</span>, or <span Class="bold">DirectColor</span>. Selects the deepest visual of the given class. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">number</span> where <span Class="emphasis">number</span> (decimal or hex) is interpreted as a visual id number,  as reported by the <span Class="manpage">xdpyinfo (1)</span>program; in this way you can have finer control over exactly which visual gets used, for example, to select a shallower one than would otherwise have been chosen. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">Note that this option specifies only the <span Class="emphasis">default</span> visual that will be used: the visual used may be overridden on a program-by-program basis. See the description of the <span Class="bold">programs</span> resource, below. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">installColormap (class \fBBoolean)</span> On PseudoColor (8-bit) displays, install a private colormap while the screensaver is active, so that the graphics hacks can get as many colors as possible.  This is the default.  (This only applies when the screen's default visual is being used, since non-default visuals get their own colormaps automatically.)  This can also be overridden on a per-hack basis: see the discussion of the <span Class="bold">default-n</span> name in the section about the <span Class="bold">programs</span> resource. 
<p class="level0">This does nothing if you have a TrueColor (16-bit or deeper) display. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">verbose (class \fBBoolean)</span> Whether to print diagnostics.  Default false. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">timestamp (class \fBBoolean)</span> Whether to print the time of day along with any other diagnostic messages. Default true. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">splash (class \fBBoolean)</span> Whether to display a splash screen at startup.  Default true. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">splashDuration (class \fBTime)</span> How long the splash screen should remain visible; default 5 seconds. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">helpURL (class \fBURL)</span> The splash screen has a <span Class="emphasis">Help</span> button on it.  When you press it, it will display the web page indicated here in your web browser. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">loadURL (class \fBLoadURL)</span> This is the shell command used to load a URL into your web browser. The default setting will load it into Mozilla/Netscape if it is already running, otherwise, will launch a new browser looking at the <span Class="emphasis">helpURL</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">demoCommand (class \fBDemoCommand)</span> This is the shell command run when the <span Class="emphasis">Demo</span> button on the splash window is pressed.  It defaults to <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1).</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">prefsCommand (class \fBPrefsCommand)</span> This is the shell command run when the <span Class="emphasis">Prefs</span> button on the splash window is pressed.  It defaults to <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-demo&nbsp;-prefs</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">newLoginCommand (class \fBNewLoginCommand)</span> If set, this is the shell command that is run when the "New Login" button is pressed on the unlock dialog box, in order to create a new desktop session without logging out the user who has locked the screen. Typically this will be some variant of <span Class="manpage">gdmflexiserver (1)</span>or <span Class="manpage">kdmctl (1).</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">nice (class \fBNice)</span> The sub-processes created by <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> will be "niced" to this level, so that they are given lower priority than other processes on the system, and don't increase the load unnecessarily.  The default is 10.   (Higher numbers mean lower priority; see  <span Class="manpage">nice (1)</span>for details.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">fade (class \fBBoolean)</span> If this is true, then when the screensaver activates, the current contents of the screen will fade to black instead of simply winking out.  This only works on certain systems.  A fade will also be done when switching graphics hacks (when the <span Class="emphasis">cycle</span> timer expires.)  Default: true.   
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">unfade (class \fBBoolean)</span> If this is true, then when the screensaver deactivates, the original contents of the screen will fade in from black instead of appearing immediately.  This only works on certain systems, and if <span Class="emphasis">fade</span> is true as well. Default false. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">fadeSeconds (class \fBTime)</span> If <span Class="emphasis">fade</span> is true, this is how long the fade will be in  seconds (default 3 seconds.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">fadeTicks (class \fBInteger)</span> If <span Class="emphasis">fade</span> is true, this is how many times a second the colormap will be changed to effect a fade.  Higher numbers yield smoother fades, but may make the fades take longer than the specified <span Class="emphasis">fadeSeconds</span> if your server isn't fast enough to keep up.  Default 20. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">captureStderr (class \fBBoolean)</span> Whether <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> should redirect its stdout and stderr streams to the window itself.  Since its nature is to take over the screen, you would not normally see error messages generated by xscreensaver or the sub-programs it runs; this resource will cause the output of all relevant programs to be drawn on the screensaver window itself, as well as being written to the controlling terminal of the screensaver driver process.  Default true. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ignoreUninstalledPrograms (class \fBBoolean)</span> There may be programs in the list that are not installed on the system, yet are marked as "enabled."  If this preference is true, then such  programs will simply be ignored.  If false, then a warning will be printed if an attempt is made to run the nonexistent program.  Also, the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>program will suppress the non-existent programs from the list if this is true.  Default: false. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">authWarningSlack (class \fBInteger)</span> If <span Class="emphasis">all</span> failed unlock attempts (incorrect password entered) were made within this period of time, the usual dialog that warns about such attempts after a successful login will be suppressed. The assumption is that incorrect passwords entered within a few seconds of a correct one are user error, rather than hostile action.  Default 20 seconds. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GetViewPortIsFullOfLies (class \fBBoolean)</span> Set this to true if the xscreensaver window doesn't cover the whole screen. This works around a longstanding XFree86 bug &#35;421.  See the  xscreensaver FAQ for details. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">font (class \fBFont)</span> The font used for the stdout/stderr text, if <span Class="bold">captureStderr</span> is true. Default <span Class="bold">*-medium-r-*-140-*-m-*</span> (a 14 point fixed-width font.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">mode (class \fBMode)</span> Controls the behavior of xscreensaver.  Legal values are: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">random</span> When blanking the screen, select a random display mode from among those that are enabled and applicable.  This is the default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">random-same</span> Like <span Class="emphasis">random</span>, but if there are multiple screens, each screen will run the <span Class="emphasis">same</span> random display mode, instead of each screen running a different one. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">one</span> When blanking the screen, only ever use one particular display mode (the one indicated by the <span Class="emphasis">selected</span> setting.) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">blank</span> When blanking the screen, just go black: don't run any graphics hacks. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">off</span> Don't ever blank the screen, and don't ever allow the monitor to power down. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">selected (class \fBInteger)</span> When <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> is set to <span Class="emphasis">one</span>, this is the one, indicated by its index in the <span Class="emphasis">programs</span> list.  You're crazy if you count them and set this number by hand: let <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>do it for you! 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">programs (class \fBPrograms)</span> The graphics hacks which <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> runs when the user is idle. The value of this resource is a multi-line string, one <span Class="emphasis">sh</span>-syntax command per line.  Each line must contain exactly one command: no semicolons, no ampersands. 
<p class="level0">When the screensaver starts up, one of these is selected (according to the <span Class="bold">mode</span> setting), and run.  After the <span Class="emphasis">cycle</span> period expires, it is killed, and another is selected and run. 
<p class="level0">If a line begins with a dash (-) then that particular program is disabled: it won't be selected at random (though you can still select it explicitly using the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>program.) 
<p class="level0">If all programs are disabled, then the screen will just be made blank, as when <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> is set to <span Class="emphasis">blank</span>. 
<p class="level0">To disable a program, you must mark it as disabled with a dash instead of removing it from the list.  This is because the system-wide (app-defaults) and per-user (.xscreensaver) settings are merged together, and if a user just <span Class="emphasis">deletes</span> an entry from their programs list, but that entry still exists in the system-wide list, then it will come back.  However, if the user <span Class="emphasis">disables</span> it, then their setting takes precedence. 
<p class="level0">If the display has multiple screens, then a different program will be run for each screen.  (All screens are blanked and unblanked simultaneously.) 
<p class="level0">Note that you must escape the newlines; here is an example of how you might set this in your <span Class="emphasis">~/.xscreensaver</span> file: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">programs:  \ &nbsp;      qix -root                          \n\ &nbsp;      ico -r -faces -sleep 1 -obj ico    \n\ &nbsp;      xdaliclock -builtin2 -root         \n\ &nbsp;      xv -root -rmode 5 image.gif -quit  \n 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">Make sure your <span Class="bold">$PATH</span> environment variable is set up correctly <span Class="emphasis">before</span> xscreensaver is launched, or it won't be able to find the programs listed in the <span Class="emphasis">programs</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">To use a program as a screensaver, two things are required: that that program draw on the root window (or be able to be configured to draw on the root window); and that that program understand "virtual root" windows, as used by virtual window managers such as <span Class="manpage">tvtwm (1).</span>(Generally, this is accomplished by just including the <span Class="emphasis">"vroot.h"</span>  header file in the program's source.) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">Visuals:</span> 
<p class="level1">Because xscreensaver was created back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, it still contains support for some things you've probably never seen, such as 1-bit monochrome monitors, grayscale monitors, and monitors capable of displaying only 8-bit colormapped images. 
<p class="level1">If there are some programs that you want to run only when using a color display, and others that you want to run only when using a monochrome display, you can specify that like this: 
<p class="level1">&nbsp;      mono:   mono-program  -root        \n\ &nbsp;      color:  color-program -root        \n\ 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">More generally, you can specify the kind of visual that should be used for the window on which the program will be drawing.  For example, if one  program works best if it has a colormap, but another works best if it has a 24-bit visual, both can be accommodated: 
<p class="level1">&nbsp;      PseudoColor: cmap-program  -root   \n\ &nbsp;      TrueColor:   24bit-program -root   \n\ 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">In addition to the symbolic visual names described above (in the discussion of the <span Class="emphasis">visualID</span> resource) one other visual name is supported in the <span Class="emphasis">programs</span> list: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2"><span Class="bold">default-n</span> This is like <span Class="bold">default</span>, but also requests the use of the default colormap, instead of a private colormap.  (That is, it behaves as if  the <span Class="emphasis">-no-install</span> command-line option was specified, but only for this particular hack.)  This is provided because some third-party programs that draw on the root window (notably:  <span Class="manpage">xv (1)</span>and <span Class="manpage">xearth (1))</span>make assumptions about the visual and colormap of the root window:  assumptions which xscreensaver can violate. 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level1">If you specify a particular visual for a program, and that visual does not exist on the screen, then that program will not be chosen to run.  This means that on displays with multiple screens of different depths, you can arrange for appropriate hacks to be run on each.  For example, if one screen is color and the other is monochrome, hacks that look good in mono can be  run on one, and hacks that only look good in color will show up on the other. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">You shouldn't ever need to change the following resources: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pointerPollTime (class \fBTime)</span> When server extensions are not in use, this controls how  frequently <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> checks to see if the mouse position or buttons have changed.  Default 5 seconds. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pointerHysteresis (class \fBInteger)</span> If the mouse moves less than this-many pixels in a second, ignore it (do not consider that to be "activity.")  This is so that the screen doesn't un-blank (or fail to blank) just because you bumped the desk. Default: 10 pixels. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">windowCreationTimeout (class \fBTime)</span> When server extensions are not in use, this controls the delay between when  windows are created and when <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> selects events on them. Default 30 seconds. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">initialDelay (class \fBTime)</span> When server extensions are not in use, <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> will wait this many seconds before selecting events on existing windows, under the assumption that  <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> is started during your login procedure, and the window  state may be in flux.  Default 0.  (This used to default to 30, but that was back in the days when slow machines and X terminals were more common...) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">procInterrupts (class \fBBoolean)</span> This resource controls whether the <span Class="bold">/proc/interrupts</span> file should be consulted to decide whether the user is idle.  This is the default if <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> has been compiled on a system which supports this mechanism (i.e., Linux systems.)   
<p class="level0">The benefit to doing this is that <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> can note that the user is active even when the X console is not the active one: if the user is  typing in another virtual console, xscreensaver will notice that and will fail to activate.  For example, if you're playing Quake in VGA-mode,  xscreensaver won't wake up in the middle of your game and start competing  for CPU. 
<p class="level0">The drawback to doing this is that perhaps you <span Class="emphasis">really do</span> want idleness on the X console to cause the X display to lock, even if there is activity on other virtual consoles.  If you want that, then set this option to False. (Or just lock the X console manually.) 
<p class="level0">The default value for this resource is True, on systems where it works. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">overlayStderr (class \fBBoolean)</span> If <span Class="bold">captureStderr</span> is True, and your server supports "overlay" visuals, then the text will be written into one of the higher layers instead of into the same layer as the running screenhack.  Set this to False to disable  that (though you shouldn't need to.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">overlayTextForeground (class \fBForeground)</span> The foreground color used for the stdout/stderr text, if <span Class="bold">captureStderr</span> is true.  Default: Yellow. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">overlayTextBackground (class \fBBackground)</span> The background color used for the stdout/stderr text, if <span Class="bold">captureStderr</span> is true.  Default: Black. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">bourneShell (class \fBBourneShell)</span> The pathname of the shell that <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> uses to start subprocesses. This must be whatever your local variant of <span Class="bold">/bin/sh</span> is: in particular, it must not be <span Class="bold">csh</span>. <a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">DISPLAY</span> to get the default host and display number, and to inform the sub-programs of the screen on which to draw. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</span> Passed to sub-programs to indicate the ID of the window on which they should draw.  This is necessary on Xinerama/RANDR systems where multiple physical monitors share a single X11 "Screen".
