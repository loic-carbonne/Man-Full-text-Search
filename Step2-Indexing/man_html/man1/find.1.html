<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">find </span> [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [path...] [expression] <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">This manual page documents the GNU version of <span Class="manpage">find .</span>GNU <span Class="bold">find</span> searches the directory tree rooted at each given file name by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for <span Class="emphasis">and</span> operations, true for <span Class="emphasis">or</span>), at which point <span Class="bold">find</span> moves on to the next file name. 
<p class="level0">If you are using  <span Class="bold">find </span> in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other users), you should read the "Security Considerations" chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called <span Class="bold">Finding Files</span> and comes with findutils.   That document also includes a lot more detail  and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful  source of information. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The  <a class="manpage" href="#-H">-H</a><a class="bold" href="#-L">-L </a> and  <a class="bold" href="#-P">-P</a> options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression  <a class="bold" href="#-print">-print</a> is used (but you should probably consider using  <a class="bold" href="#-print0">-print0</a> instead, anyway). 
<p class="level0">This manual page talks about `options' within the expression list. These options control the behaviour of  <span Class="bold">find</span> but are specified immediately after the last path name.  The five `real' options <a class="manpage" href="#-H">-H</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#-L">-L</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#-P">-P</a><a class="bold" href="#-D">-D </a> and  <span Class="bold">-O</span> must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash  <span Class="bold">--</span> can also be used to signal that any remaining arguments are not options (though ensuring that all start points begin with either `./' or `/' is generally safer if you use wildcards in the list of start points). 
<p class="level0"><a name="-P"></a><span class="nroffip">-P</span> 
<p class="level1">Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When  <span Class="bold">find</span> examines or prints information a file, and the file is a symbolic link, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.   
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="-L"></a><span class="nroffip">-L</span> 
<p class="level1">Follow symbolic links.  When  <span Class="bold">find</span> examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the file to which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or  <span Class="bold">find</span> is unable to examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this option implies  <a class="manpage" href="#-noleaf">-noleaf .</a>If you later use the  <a class="bold" href="#-P">-P </a> option,  <a class="bold" href="#-noleaf">-noleaf</a> will still be in effect.  If  <a class="bold" href="#-L">-L </a> is in effect and  <span Class="bold">find </span> discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search,  the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic link will be searched. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">When the  <a class="bold" href="#-L">-L </a> option is in effect, the  <a class="bold" href="#-type">-type </a> predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken). Using  <a class="bold" href="#-L">-L </a> causes the  <a class="bold" href="#-lname">-lname </a> and  <a class="bold" href="#-ilname">-ilname </a> predicates always to return false. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="-H"></a><span class="nroffip">-H</span> 
<p class="level1">Do not follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When <span Class="bold">find</span> examines or prints information about files, the information used  shall be taken from the properties of the symbolic link itself.   The only exception to this behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link, and the link can be resolved.  For that situation, the information used is taken from whatever the link points to (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link itself is used as a fallback if the file pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If  <a class="bold" href="#-H">-H </a> is in effect and one of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to a directory, the contents of that directory will be examined (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this). 
<p class="level1">If more than one of  <a class="manpage" href="#-H">-H</a><a class="bold" href="#-L">-L </a> and  <a class="bold" href="#-P">-P </a> is specified, each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect. Since it is the default, the  <a class="bold" href="#-P">-P </a> option should be considered to be in effect unless either  <a class="bold" href="#-H">-H </a> or  <a class="bold" href="#-L">-L </a> is specified. 
<p class="level1">GNU  <span Class="bold">find</span> frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of tests that compare files listed on the command line against a file we are currently considering.  In each case, the file specified on the command line will have been examined and some of its properties will have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the  <a class="bold" href="#-P">-P </a> option is in effect (or if neither  <a class="bold" href="#-H">-H </a> nor  <a class="bold" href="#-L">-L </a> were specified), the information used for the comparison will be taken from the properties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the file the link points to.  If <span Class="bold">find </span> cannot follow the link (for example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used. 
<p class="level1">When the  <a class="bold" href="#-H">-H </a> or  <a class="bold" href="#-L">-L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed</a> as the argument of  <a class="bold" href="#-newer">-newer </a> will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will be taken from the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same consideration applies to  <a class="manpage" href="#-newerXY">-newerXY</a><a class="bold" href="#-anewer">-anewer </a> and  <a class="manpage" href="#-cnewer">-cnewer .</a>
<p class="level1">The  <a class="bold" href="#-follow">-follow </a> option has a similar effect to  <a class="manpage" href="#-L">-L</a>though it takes effect at the point where it appears (that is, if  <a class="bold" href="#-L">-L</a> is not used but <a class="bold" href="#-follow">-follow</a> is, any symbolic links appearing after  <a class="bold" href="#-follow">-follow</a> on the command line will be dereferenced, and those before it will not).

<p class="level0"><a name="-Olevel"></a><span class="nroffip">-Olevel</span> 
<p class="level1">Enables query optimisation.   The  <span Class="bold">find </span> program reorders tests to speed up execution while preserving the overall effect; that is, predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to each other.  The optimisations performed at each optimisation level are as follows. 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level1"><a name="0"></a><span class="nroffip">0</span> 
<p class="level2">Equivalent to optimisation level 1. 
<p class="level1"><a name="1"></a><span class="nroffip">1</span> 
<p class="level2">This is the default optimisation level and corresponds to the traditional behaviour.  Expressions are reordered so that tests based only on the names of files (for example  <a class="bold" href="#-name">-name </a> and  <a class="manpage" href="#-regex">-regex )</a>are performed first. 
<p class="level1"><a name="2"></a><span class="nroffip">2</span> 
<p class="level2">Any  <a class="bold" href="#-type">-type </a> or  <a class="bold" href="#-xtype">-xtype </a> tests are performed after any tests based only on the names of files, but before any tests that require information from the inode.  On many modern versions of Unix, file types are returned by <span Class="bold">readdir() </span> and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than predicates which need to stat the file first. 
<p class="level1"><a name="3"></a><span class="nroffip">3</span> 
<p class="level2">At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query optimiser is enabled.  The order of tests is modified so that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more expensive ones are performed later, if necessary.  Within each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or later according to whether they are likely to succeed or not.  For  , <span Class="manpage">-o</span>predicates which are likely to succeed are evaluated earlier, and for  <span Class="manpage">-a</span>predicates which are likely to fail are evaluated earlier. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The cost-based optimiser has a fixed idea of how likely any given test is to succeed.  In some cases the probability takes account of the specific nature of the test (for example,  <a class="bold" href="#-type">-type f</a> is assumed to be more likely to succeed than  <a class="manpage" href="#-type">-type c ).</a>The cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.   If it does not actually improve the performance of  <span Class="manpage">find</span>it will be removed again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove to be reliable, robust and effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels over time.  However, the default behaviour (i.e. optimisation level 1) will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The findutils test suite runs all the tests on  <span Class="bold">find</span> at each optimisation level and ensures that the result is the same. 
<p class="level1"><a name="EXPRESSIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EXPRESSIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The expression is made up of options (which affect overall operation rather than the processing of a specific file, and always return true), tests (which return a true or false value), and actions (which have side effects and return a true or false value), all separated by operators.   <span Class="bold">-and</span> is assumed where the operator is omitted.   
<p class="level0">If the expression contains no actions other than  <a class="manpage" href="#-prune">-prune</a><a class="bold" href="#-print">-print</a> is performed on all files for which the expression is true. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>

Except for  <a class="manpage" href="#-daystart">-daystart</a><a class="bold" href="#-follow">-follow</a> and <a class="manpage" href="#-regextype">-regextype</a>the options affect all tests, including tests specified before the option.  This is because the options are processed when the command line is parsed, while the tests don't do anything until files are examined.  The  <a class="manpage" href="#-daystart">-daystart</a><a class="bold" href="#-follow">-follow </a> and  <a class="bold" href="#-regextype">-regextype</a> options are different in this respect, and have an effect only on tests which appear later in the command line.  Therefore, for clarity, it is best to place them at the beginning of the expression.  A warning is issued if you don't do this.

This option is needed when searching filesystems that do not follow the Unix directory-link convention, such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume mount points.  Each directory on a normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard links: its name and its `.'  entry.  Additionally, its subdirectories (if any) each have a `..'  entry linked to that directory.  When <span Class="bold">find</span> is examining a directory, after it has statted 2 fewer subdirectories than the directory's link count, it knows that the rest of the entries in the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the directory tree).  If only the files' names need to be examined, there is no need to stat them; this gives a significant increase in search speed.

<p class="level1">File's permission bits are exactly <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> (octal or symbolic). Since an exact match is required, if you want to use this form for symbolic modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode string. For example  <a class="bold" href="#-perm">-perm g=w</a> will only match files which have mode 0020 (that is, ones for which group write permission is the only permission set).  It is more likely that you will want to use the `/' or `-' forms, for example  <a class="manpage" href="#-perm">-perm -g=w</a>which matches any file with group write permission.  See the <a class="bold" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES </a> section for some illustrative examples.

<p class="level1">All of the permission bits <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> are set for the file. Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this is usually the way in which would want to use them.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.

If no permission bits in  <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> are set, this test matches any file (the idea here is to be consistent with the behaviour of   <a class="bold" href="#-perm">-perm </a> <span Class="manpage">-000 ).</span>

<p class="level1">Deprecated, old way of searching for files with any of the permission bits in <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> set.  You should use <a class="bold" href="#-perm">-perm /mode</a> instead. Trying to use the `+' syntax with symbolic modes will yield surprising results.  For example, `+u+x' is a valid symbolic mode (equivalent to +u,+x, i.e. 0111) and will therefore not be evaluated as <a class="bold" href="#-perm">-perm +mode</a> but instead as the exact mode specifier <a class="bold" href="#-perm">-perm mode</a> and so it matches files with exact permissions 0111 instead of files with any execute bit set.  If you found this paragraph confusing, you're not alone - just use  <a class="bold" href="#-perm">-perm /mode.</a> This form of the  <a class="bold" href="#-perm">-perm</a> test is deprecated because the POSIX specification requires the interpretation of a leading `+' as being part of a symbolic mode, and so we switched to using `/' instead.

<p class="level2">File's permission bits (in octal).  This option uses the `traditional' numbers which most Unix implementations use, but if your particular  implementation uses an unusual ordering of octal permissions bits, you will see a difference between the actual value of the file's mode and the output of %m.   Normally you will want to have a leading zero on this number, and to do this, you should use the  <a class="bold" href="#">#</a> flag (as in, for example, `%&#35;m').

<p class="level1"><a name="S"></a><span class="nroffip">%S </span> 
<p class="level2">File's sparseness.  This is calculated as (BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks / st_size).  The exact value you will get for an ordinary file of a certain length is system-dependent.  However, normally sparse files will have values less than 1.0, and files which use indirect blocks may have a value which is greater than 1.0.   The value used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent, but is usually 512 bytes.   If the file size is zero, the value printed is undefined.  On systems which lack support for st_blocks, a file's sparseness is assumed to be 1.0.

<p class="level2">File's type (like %y), plus follow symlinks: L=loop, N=nonexistent 
<p class="level2">A `%' character followed by any other character is discarded, but the other character is printed (don't rely on this, as further format characters may be introduced).  A `%' at the end of the format argument causes undefined behaviour since there is no following character.  In some locales, it may hide your door keys, while in others it may remove the final page from the novel you are reading. 
<p class="level2">The %m and %d directives support the  <a class="bold" href="#">#</a> ,  <a class="bold" href="#0">0 </a> and  <a class="bold" href="#">+ </a> flags, but the other directives do not, even if they print numbers.  Numeric directives that do not support these flags include  <a class="manpage" href="#G">G</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#U">U</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#b">b</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#D">D</a><a class="bold" href="#k">k </a> and  <a class="manpage" href="#n">n .</a>The `-' format flag is supported and changes the alignment of a field from right-justified (which is the default) to left-justified.

<p class="level1"><a name="UNUSUAL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">UNUSUAL FILENAMES</h2>
<p class="level0">Many of the actions of  <span Class="bold">find</span> result in the printing of data which is under the control of other users.  This includes file names, sizes, modification times and so forth.  File names are a potential problem since they can contain any character except `e0' and `/'.  Unusual characters in file names can do unexpected and often undesirable things to your terminal (for example, changing the settings of your function keys on some terminals).  Unusual characters are handled differently by various actions, as described below. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="-print0"></a><span class="nroffip">-print0, -fprint0\</span> 
<p class="level1">Always print the exact filename, unchanged, even if the output is going to a terminal. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="-ls"></a><span class="nroffip">-ls, -fls</span> 
<p class="level1">Unusual characters are always escaped.  White space, backslash, and double quote characters are printed using C-style escaping (for example `ef', `e"').  Other unusual characters are printed using an octal escape.  Other printable characters (for  <a class="bold" href="#-ls">-ls </a> and  <a class="bold" href="#-fls">-fls </a> these are the characters between octal 041 and 0176) are printed as-is. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="-printf"></a><span class="nroffip">-printf, -fprintf</span> 
<p class="level1">If the output is not going to a terminal, it is printed as-is. Otherwise, the result depends on which directive is in use.  The directives %D, %F, %g, %G, %H, %Y, and %y expand to values which are not under control of files' owners, and so are printed as-is.  The directives %a, %b, %c, %d, %i, %k, %m, %M, %n, %s, %t, %u and %U have values which are under the control of files' owners but which cannot be used to send arbitrary data to the terminal, and so these are printed as-is.  The directives %f, %h, %l, %p and %P are quoted.  This quoting is performed in the same way as for GNU <span Class="manpage">ls .</span>This is not the same quoting mechanism as the one used for <a class="bold" href="#-ls">-ls </a> and <a class="manpage" href="#-fls">-fls .</a>If you are able to decide what format to use for the output of  <span Class="bold">find</span> then it is normally better to use `e0' as a terminator than to use newline, as file names can contain white space and newline characters.  The setting of the `LC_CTYPE' environment variable is used to determine which characters need to be quoted. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="-print"></a><span class="nroffip">-print, -fprint</span> 
<p class="level1">Quoting is handled in the same way as for  <a class="bold" href="#-printf">-printf</a> and  <a class="manpage" href="#-fprintf">-fprintf .</a>If you are using  <span Class="bold">find</span> in a script or in a situation where the matched files might have arbitrary names, you should consider using  <a class="bold" href="#-print0">-print0 </a> instead of <a class="manpage" href="#-print">-print .</a>
<p class="level1">The  <a class="bold" href="#-ok">-ok </a> and  <a class="bold" href="#-okdir">-okdir</a> actions print the current filename as-is.  This may change in a future release.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">The POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(', `)', negation `!' and the `and' and `or' operators ( <span Class="manpage">-a</span>, <span Class="manpage">-o ).</span>
<p class="level1">All other options, predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions  beyond the POSIX standard.  Many of these extensions are not unique to  GNU find, however. 
<p class="level1">The POSIX standard requires that  <span Class="bold">find </span> detects loops: 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The  <span Class="bold">find</span> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file encountered. When it detects an infinite loop, find shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or terminate. 
<p class="level1">GNU  <span Class="bold">find </span> complies with these requirements.  The link count of directories which contain entries which are hard links to an ancestor will often be lower than they otherwise should be.  This can mean that GNU find will sometimes optimise away the visiting of a subdirectory which is actually a link to an ancestor.  Since <span Class="bold">find</span> does not actually enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid emitting a diagnostic message.  Although this behaviour may be somewhat confusing, it is unlikely that anybody actually depends on this behaviour.  If the leaf optimisation has been turned off with <a class="manpage" href="#-noleaf">-noleaf</a>the directory entry will always be examined and the diagnostic message will be issued where it is appropriate.  Symbolic links cannot be used to create filesystem cycles as such, but if the  <a class="bold" href="#-L">-L</a> option or the <a class="bold" href="#-follow">-follow</a> option is in use, a diagnostic message is issued when  <span Class="bold">find </span> encounters a loop of symbolic links.  As with loops containing hard links, the leaf optimisation will often mean that  <span Class="bold">find</span> knows that it doesn't need to call  <a class="emphasis" href="#stat">stat()</a> or <span Class="emphasis">chdir() </span> on the symbolic link, so this diagnostic is frequently not necessary. 
<p class="level1">The  <a class="bold" href="#-d">-d</a> option is supported for compatibility with various BSD systems, but you should use the POSIX-compliant option  <a class="bold" href="#-depth">-depth</a> instead. 
<p class="level1">The POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable does not affect the behaviour of the  <a class="bold" href="#-regex">-regex </a> or  <a class="bold" href="#-iregex">-iregex </a> tests because those tests aren't specified in the POSIX standard. <a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>

<p class="level0"><a name="LCCOLLATE"></a><span class="nroffip">LC_COLLATE</span> 
<p class="level1">The POSIX standard specifies that this variable affects the pattern matching to be used for the  <a class="bold" href="#-name">-name</a> option.   GNU find uses the  <span Class="manpage">fnmatch (3)</span>library function, and so support for `LC_COLLATE' depends on the system library.    This variable also affects the interpretation of the response to  <a class="manpage" href="#-ok">-ok;</a>while the `LC_MESSAGES' variable selects the actual pattern used to interpret the response to  <a class="manpage" href="#-ok">-ok</a>the interpretation of any bracket expressions in the pattern will be affected by `LC_COLLATE'. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="LCCTYPE"></a><span class="nroffip">LC_CTYPE </span> 
<p class="level1">This variable affects the treatment of character classes used in regular expressions and also with  the  <a class="bold" href="#-name">-name</a> test, if the system's  <span Class="manpage">fnmatch (3)</span>library function supports this.  This variable also affects the  interpretation of any character classes in the regular expressions used to interpret the response to the prompt issued by  <a class="manpage" href="#-ok">-ok .</a>The `LC_CTYPE' environment variable will also affect which characters are considered to be unprintable when filenames are printed; see the section UNUSUAL FILENAMES.

<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">Setting this variable also turns off warning messages (that is, implies <span Class="manpage">-nowarn )</span>by default, because POSIX requires that apart from the output for  <a class="manpage" href="#-ok">-ok</a>all messages printed on stderr are diagnostics and must result in a non-zero exit status. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span>

<p class="level0">This command copies the contents of  <span Class="bold">/source-dir</span> to  <span Class="manpage">/dest-dir</span>but omits files and directories named  <span Class="bold">.snapshot </span> (and anything in them).

The construct  <a class="bold" href="#-prune">-prune -o \e( ... -print0 \e)</a> is quite common.  The idea here is that the expression before  <a class="bold" href="#-prune">-prune </a> matches things which are to be pruned.  However, the  <a class="bold" href="#-prune">-prune </a> action itself returns true, so the following  <span Class="bold">-o </span> ensures that the right hand side is evaluated only for those directories which didn't get pruned (the contents of the pruned directories are not even visited, so their contents are irrelevant). The expression on the right hand side of the  <span Class="bold">-o</span> is in parentheses only for clarity.  It emphasises that the <a class="bold" href="#-print0">-print0 </a> action takes place only for things that didn't have  <a class="bold" href="#-prune">-prune </a> applied to them.  Because the default `and' condition between tests binds more tightly than  <span Class="manpage">-o</span>this is the default anyway, but the parentheses help to show what is going on.

<p class="level0">In this example, <a class="bold" href="#-prune">-prune</a> prevents unnecessary descent into directories that have already been discovered (for example we do not search project3/src because we already found project3/.svn), but ensures sibling directories (project2 and project3) are found.
