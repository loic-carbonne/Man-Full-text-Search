<p class="level0">This manual page documents the GNU version of <span Class="manpage">locate .</span>For each given pattern, <span Class="bold">locate</span> searches one or more databases of file names and displays the file names that contain the pattern.  Patterns can contain shell-style metacharacters: `*', `?', and `[]'.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.'  specially.  Therefore, a pattern `foo*bar' can match a file name that contains `foo3/bar', and a pattern `*duck*' can match a file name that contains `lake/.ducky'.  Patterns that contain metacharacters should be quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell. 
<p class="level0">If a pattern is a plain string (em it contains no metacharacters (em <span Class="bold">locate</span> displays all file names in the database that contain that string anywhere.  If a pattern does contain metacharacters, <span Class="bold">locate</span> only displays file names that match the pattern exactly.  As a result, patterns that contain metacharacters should usually begin with a `*', and will most often end with one as well.  The exceptions are patterns that are intended to explicitly match the beginning or end of a file name. 
<p class="level0">The file name databases contain lists of files that were on the system when the databases were last updated.  The system administrator can choose the file name of the default database, the frequency with which the databases are updated, and the directories for which they contain entries; see <span Class="bold">updatedb</span>(1). 
<p class="level0">If  <span Class="manpage">locate 's</span>output is going to a terminal, unusual characters in the output are  escaped in the same way as for the -print action of the  <span Class="bold">find</span> command.  If the output is not going to a terminal, file names are printed exactly as-is. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">-0, --null</span> Use ASCII NUL as a separator, instead of newline.    
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">-A, --all</span> Print only names which match all non-option arguments, not those matching one or more non-option arguments. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">-b, --basename</span> Results are considered to match if the pattern specified matches the final component of the name of a file as listed in the database. This final component is usually referred to as the `base name'. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">-c, --count</span> Instead of printing the matched filenames, just print the total  number of matches we found, unless --<span Class="emphasis">print</span> (-p) is also present. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">-d \fIpath\fP, --database=\fIpath\fP</span> Instead of searching the default file name database, search the file name databases in <span Class="emphasis">path</span>, which is a colon-separated list of database file names.  You can also use the environment variable <span Class="bold">LOCATE_PATH</span> to set the list of database files to search. The option overrides the environment variable if both are used.  Empty elements in the path are taken to be synonyms for the file name of the default database. A database can be supplied on stdin, using `-' as an element of <span Class="emphasis">path</span>. If more than one element of <span Class="emphasis">path</span> is `-', later instances are ignored (and a warning message is printed). 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The file name database format changed starting with GNU <span Class="bold">find</span> and <span Class="bold">locate</span> version 4.0 to allow machines with different byte orderings to share the databases.  This version of <span Class="bold">locate</span> can automatically recognize and read databases produced for older versions of GNU <span Class="bold">locate</span> or Unix versions of <span Class="bold">locate</span> or <span Class="manpage">find .</span>Support for the old locate database format will be discontinued in a future release. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-e, --existing</span> Only print out such names that currently exist (instead of such names that existed when the database was created). Note that this may slow down the program a lot, if there are many matches in the database.  If you are using this option within a program, please note that it is possible for the file to be deleted after  <span Class="bold">locate </span> has checked that it exists, but before you use it. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-E, --non-existing</span> Only print out such names that currently do not exist (instead of such names that existed when the database was created). Note that this may slow down the program a lot, if there are many matches in the database. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">--help</span> Print a summary of the options to <span Class="bold">locate</span> and exit. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-i, --ignore-case</span> Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the file names. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-l N, --limit=N</span> Limit the number of matches to N.  If a limit is set via this option, the number of results printed for the -c option will never be larger than this number. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-L, --follow</span> If testing for the existence of files (with the -e or -E options), consider broken symbolic links to be non-existing.   This is the default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">--max-database-age D</span> Normally,  <span Class="bold">locate</span> will issue a warning message when it searches a database which is more than 8 days old.  This option changes that value to something other than 8.  The effect of specifying a negative value is undefined. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-m, --mmap</span> Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD  <span Class="manpage">locate .</span>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-P, -H, --nofollow</span> If testing for the existence of files (with the -e or -E options), treat broken symbolic links as if they were existing files.  The -H form of this option is provided purely for similarity with <span Class="manpage">find ;</span>the use of -P is recommended over -H. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-p, --print</span> Print search results when they normally would not, because of the presence of --statistics (-S) or --count (-c). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-r, --regex </span> The pattern specified on the command line is understood to be a regular expression, as opposed to a glob pattern.  The Regular expressions work in the same was as in  <span Class="bold">emacs</span> and  <span Class="manpage">find</span>except for the fact that "." will match a newline. Filenames whose full paths match the specified regular expression are printed (or, in the case of the -c option, counted).  If you wish to anchor your regular expression at the ends of the full path name, then as is usual with regular expressions, you should use the characters ^ and $ to signify this.   
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-s, --stdio</span> Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD  <span Class="manpage">locate .</span>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-S, --statistics</span> Print various statistics about each locate database and then exit without performing a search, unless non-option arguments are given. For compatibility with BSD, -S is accepted as a synonym for --statistics.  However, the ouptut of  <span Class="bold">locate -S </span> is different for the GNU and BSD implementations of  <span Class="manpage">locate .</span>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">--version</span> Print the version number of <span Class="bold">locate</span> and exit. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">-w, --wholename</span> Match against the whole name of the file as listed in the database. This is the default. <a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LOCATE_PATH</span> Colon-separated list of databases to search.  If the value has a leading or trailing colon, or has two colons in a row, you may get results that vary between different versions of  <span Class="manpage">locate .</span>

<p class="level0">The  <span Class="bold">locate</span> program started life as the BSD fast find program, contributed to BSD by James A. Woods.  This was described by his paper  <span Class="emphasis">Finding Files Fast</span> which was published in Usenix  <span Class="emphasis">;login: , </span> Vol 8, No 1, February/March, 1983, pp. 8-10.   When the  <span Class="bold">find </span> program began to assume a default <span Class="bold">-print </span> action if no action was specified, this changed the interpretation of <span Class="bold">find </span> <span Class="manpage">pattern .</span>The BSD developers therefore moved the fast find functionality into  <span Class="manpage">locate .</span>The GNU implementation of  <span Class="bold">locate</span> appears to be derived from the same code.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The locate database correctly handles filenames containing newlines, but only if the system's sort command has a working -z option.  If you suspect that  <span Class="bold">locate</span> may need to return filenames containing newlines, consider using its <span Class="emphasis">--null </span> option.
