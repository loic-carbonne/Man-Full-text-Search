<p class="level0">dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dvips</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">file [\fB.dvi\fP]</span> <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">THIS MAN PAGE IS OBSOLETE! See the Texinfo documentation instead. You can read it either in Emacs or with the standalone  <span Class="bold">info</span> program which comes with the GNU texinfo distribution as ftp.gnu.org:pub/gnu/texinfo/texinfo*.tar.gz. 
<p class="level0">The program <span Class="bold">dvips</span> takes a DVI file <span Class="emphasis">file [\fB.dvi\fP]</span> produced by TeX (or by some other processor such as GFtoDVI) and converts it to PostScript, sending the output to a file or directly to a printer.  The DVI file may be specified without the <span Class="bold">.dvi</span> extension.  Fonts used may either be resident in the printer or defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a `virtual' combination of both.  If the <span Class="bold">mktexpk</span> program is installed, <span Class="bold">dvips</span> will automatically invoke METAFONT to generate fonts that don't already exist. 
<p class="level0">For more information, see the Texinfo manual  <span Class="emphasis">dvips.texi ,</span> which should be installed somewhere on your system, hopefully accessible through the standard Info tree. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-a</span> Conserve memory by making three passes over the .dvi file instead of two and only loading those characters actually used.  Generally only useful on machines with a very limited amount of memory, like some PCs. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-A</span> Print only odd pages (TeX pages, not sequence pages). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-b num</span> Generate <span Class="emphasis">num</span> copies of each page, but duplicating the page body rather than using the <span Class="emphasis">#numcopies</span> option.  This can be useful in conjunction with a header file setting <span Class="emphasis">\ebop-hook</span> to do color separations or other neat tricks. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-B</span> Print only even pages (TeX pages, not sequence pages). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-c num</span> Generate <span Class="emphasis">num</span> copies of every page.  Default is 1.  (For collated copies, see the <span Class="emphasis">-C</span> option below.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-C num</span> Create <span Class="emphasis">num </span> copies, but collated (by replicating the data in the PostScript file). Slower than the <span Class="emphasis">-c</span> option, but easier on the hands, and faster than resubmitting the same PostScript file multiple times. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d num</span> Set the debug flags.  This is intended only for emergencies or for unusual fact-finding expeditions; it will work only if <span Class="bold">dvips</span> has been compiled with the DEBUG option.  If nonzero, prints additional information on standard error.  For maximum information, you can use `-1'.  See the Dvips Texinfo manual for more details. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-D num</span> Set the resolution in dpi (dots per inch) to <span Class="emphasis">num .</span> This affects the choice of bitmap fonts that are loaded and also the positioning of letters in resident PostScript fonts. Must be between 10 and 10000.  This affects both the horizontal and vertical resolution. If a high resolution (something greater than 400 dpi, say) is selected, the <span Class="emphasis">-Z</span> flag should probably also be used. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-e num</span> Make sure that each character is placed at most this many pixels from its `true' resolution-independent position on the page. The default value of this parameter is resolution dependent.  Allowing individual characters to `drift' from their correctly rounded positions by a few pixels, while regaining the true position at the beginning of each new word, improves the spacing of letters in words. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-E</span> makes <span Class="bold">dvips</span> attempt to generate an EPSF file with a tight bounding box.  This only works on one-page files, and it only looks at marks made by characters and rules, not by any included graphics.  In addition, it gets the glyph metrics from the <span Class="emphasis">tfm</span> file, so characters that lie outside their enclosing <span Class="emphasis">tfm</span> box may confuse it.  In addition, the bounding box might be a bit too loose if the character glyph has significant left or right side bearings.  Nonetheless, this option works well for creating small EPSF files for equations or tables or the like.  (Note, of course, that <span Class="bold">dvips</span> output is resolution dependent and thus does not make very good EPSF files, especially if the images are to be scaled; use these EPSF files with a great deal of care.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f</span> Run as a filter.  Read the <span Class="emphasis">.dvi</span> file from standard input and write the PostScript to standard output. The standard input must be seekable, so it cannot be a pipe.  If you must use a pipe, write a shell script that copies the pipe output to a temporary file and then points <span Class="bold">dvips</span> at this file.  This option also disables the automatic reading of the <span Class="emphasis">PRINTER</span> environment variable, and turns off the automatic sending of control D if it was turned on with the <span Class="emphasis">-F</span> option or in the configuration file; use <span Class="emphasis">-F</span> after this option if you want both. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-F</span> Causes Control-D (ASCII code 4) to be appended as the very last character of the PostScript file.  This is useful when <span Class="bold">dvips</span> is driving the printer directly instead of working through a spooler, as is common on extremely small systems.  NOTE! DO NOT USE THIS OPTION! 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-G</span> Causes <span Class="bold">dvips</span> to shift non-printing characters to higher-numbered positions. This may be useful sometimes. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-h name</span> Prepend file <span Class="emphasis">name</span> as an additional header file. (However, if the name is simply `-' suppress all header files from the output.)  This header file gets added to the PostScript <span Class="emphasis">userdict .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-i</span> Make each section be a separate file.  Under certain circumstances, <span Class="bold">dvips</span> will split the document up into `sections' to be processed independently; this is most often done for memory reasons.  Using this option tells <span Class="bold">dvips</span> to place each section into a separate file; the new file names are created replacing the suffix of the supplied output file name by a three-digit sequence number.  This option is most often used in conjunction with the <span Class="emphasis">-S</span> option which sets the maximum section length in pages.  For instance, some phototypesetters cannot print more than ten or so consecutive pages before running out of steam; these options can be used to automatically split a book into ten-page sections, each to its own file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-j</span> Download only needed characters from Type 1 fonts. This is the default in the current release.  Some debugging flags trace this operation. You can also control partial downloading on a per-font basis, via the <span Class="bold">psfonts.map</span> file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-k</span> Print crop marks.  This option increases the paper size (which should be specified, either with a paper size special or with the <span Class="emphasis">-T</span> option) by a half inch in each dimension.  It translates each page by a quarter inch and draws cross-style crop marks.  It is mostly useful with typesetters that can set the page size automatically. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-K</span> This option causes comments in included PostScript graphics, font files, and headers to be removed.  This is sometimes necessary to get around bugs in spoolers or PostScript post-processing programs.  Specifically, the %%Page comments, when left in, often cause difficulties.  Use of this flag can cause some included graphics to fail, since the PostScript header macros from some software packages read portions of the input stream line by line, searching for a particular comment.  This option has been turned off by default because PostScript previewers and spoolers have been getting better. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l num</span> The last page printed will be the first one numbered <span Class="emphasis">num</span> Default is the last page in the document.  If the <span Class="emphasis">num</span> is prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and any argument to the <span Class="emphasis">-p</span> option) is treated as a sequence number, rather than a value to compare with <span Class="emphasis">\ecount0</span> values.  Thus, using <span Class="emphasis">-l =9</span> will end with the ninth page of the document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-m</span> Specify manual feed for printer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-mode mode</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">mode</span> as the Metafont device name for path searching and font generation.  This overrides any value from configuration files.  With the default paths, explicitly specifying the mode also makes the program assume the fonts are in a subdirectory named <span Class="emphasis">mode .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-M</span> Turns off the automatic font generation facility.  If any fonts are missing, commands to generate the fonts are appended to the file <span Class="emphasis">missfont.log</span> in the current directory; this file can then be executed and deleted to create the missing fonts. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-n num</span> At most <span Class="emphasis">num</span> pages will be printed. Default is 100000. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-N</span> Turns off structured comments; this might be necessary on some systems that try to interpret PostScript comments in weird ways, or on some PostScript printers.  Old versions of TranScript in particular cannot handle modern Encapsulated PostScript. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-noomega</span>This will disable the use of Omega extensions when interpreting DVI files.  By default, the additional opcodes <span Class="emphasis">129</span> and <span Class="emphasis">134</span> are recognized by dvips as Omega or pTeX extensions and interpreted as requests to set 2-byte characters. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-noptex</span>This will disable the use of pTeX extensions when interpreting DVI files. By default, the additional opcodes <span Class="emphasis">130</span> and <span Class="emphasis">135</span> are recognized by dvips as pTeX extensions and interpreted as requests to set 3-byte characters, and <span Class="emphasis">255</span> as request to change the typesetting direction. 
<p class="level0">The only drawback is that the virtual font array will (at least temporarily) require 65536 or more positions instead of the default 256 positions, i.e., the memory requirements of dvips will be somewhat larger.  If you find this unacceptable or encounter another problem with the Omega or pTeX extensions, you can switch off the pTeX extension by using <span Class="manpage">-noptex</span>or both by using <span Class="bold">-noomega</span> (but please do send a bug report if you find such problems - see the bug address in the <span Class="bold">AUTHORS</span> section below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-o name</span> The output will be sent to file <span Class="emphasis">name</span> If no file name is given (i.e., -o is last on the command line), the default name is <span Class="emphasis">file.ps</span> where the .dvi file was called <span Class="emphasis">file.dvi ;</span> if this option isn't given, any default in the configuration file is used.  If the first character of the supplied output file name is an exclamation mark, then the remainder will be used as an argument to <span Class="emphasis">popen ;</span> thus, specifying <span Class="emphasis">!lpr</span> as the output file will automatically queue the file for printing. This option also disables the automatic reading of the <span Class="emphasis">PRINTER</span> environment variable, and turns off the automatic sending of control D if it was turned on with the <span Class="emphasis">-F</span> option or in the configuration file; use <span Class="emphasis">-F</span> after this option if you want both. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-O offset</span> Move the origin by a certain amount.  The <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> is a comma-separated pair of dimensions, such as <span Class="emphasis">.1in,-.3cm</span> (in the same syntax used in the <span Class="emphasis">papersize</span> special).  The origin of the page is shifted from the default position (of one inch down, one inch to the right from the upper left corner of the paper) by this amount. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p num</span> The first page printed will be the first one numbered <span Class="emphasis">num .</span> Default is the first page in the document.  If the <span Class="emphasis">num</span> is prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and any argument to the <span Class="emphasis">-l</span> option) is treated as a sequence number, rather than a value to compare with <span Class="emphasis">\ecount0</span> values.  Thus, using <span Class="emphasis">-p =3</span> will start with the third page of the document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-pp pagelist</span> A comma-separated list of pages and ranges (a-b) may be given, which will be interpreted as  <span Class="emphasis">\ecount0</span> values.  Pages not specified will not be printed.  Multiple  <span Class="bold">-pp</span> options may be specified or all pages and page ranges can be  specified with one <span Class="bold">-pp</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-P printername</span> Sets up the output for the appropriate printer.  This is implemented by reading in <span Class="emphasis">config.printername</span> , which can then set the output pipe (as in, <span Class="emphasis">!lpr -Pprintername</span> as well as the font paths and any other <span Class="emphasis">config.ps</span> defaults for that printer only.  Note that <span Class="emphasis">config.ps</span> is read before <span Class="emphasis">config.printername</span> In addition, another file called <span Class="emphasis">~/.dvipsrc</span> is searched for immediately after <span Class="emphasis">config.ps ;</span> this file is intended for user defaults.  If no <span Class="emphasis">-P</span> command is given, the environment variable <span Class="emphasis">PRINTER</span> is checked.  If that variable exists, and a corresponding configuration file exists, that configuration file is read in. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-q</span> Run in quiet mode.  Don't chatter about pages converted, etc.; report nothing but errors to standard error. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-r</span> Stack pages in reverse order.  Normally, page 1 will be printed first. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-R[0|1|2]</span> Run securely. <span Class="manpage">-R2</span>disables both shell command execution in <span Class="emphasis">\especial'{}</span> (via backticks <span Class="manpage">`</span>) and config files (via the <span Class="emphasis">E</span> option), and opening of any absolute filenames. <span Class="manpage">-R1</span>, the default, forbids shell escapes but allows absolute filenames. <span Class="manpage">-R0</span>allows both.  The config file option is <span Class="emphasis">z</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s</span> Causes the entire global output to be enclosed in a save/restore pair. This causes the file to not be truly conformant, and is thus not recommended, but is useful if you are driving the printer directly and don't care too much about the portability of the output. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-S num</span> Set the maximum number of pages in each `section'.  This option is most commonly used with the <span Class="emphasis">-i</span> option; see that documentation above for more information. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t papertype</span> This sets the paper type to <span Class="emphasis">papertype .</span> The <span Class="emphasis">papertype</span> should be defined in one of the configuration files, along with the appropriate code to select it.  (Currently known types include <span Class="manpage">letter</span>, <span Class="manpage">legal</span>, <span Class="manpage">ledger</span>, <span Class="manpage">a4</span>, <span Class="manpage">a3 ).</span>You can also specify <span Class="manpage">-t   landscape</span>which rotates a document by 90 degrees.  To rotate a document whose size is not letter, you can use the <span Class="emphasis">-t</span> option twice, once for the page size, and once for landscape. You should not use any <span Class="emphasis">-t</span> option when the DVI file already contains a <span Class="emphasis">papersize</span> special, as is done by some LaTeX packages, notably hyperref.sty. 
<p class="level0">The upper left corner of each page in the <span Class="emphasis">.dvi</span> file is placed one inch from the left and one inch from the top.  Use of this option is highly dependent on the configuration file.  Note that executing the <span Class="bold">letter</span> or <span Class="bold">a4</span> or other PostScript operators cause the document to be nonconforming and can cause it not to print on certain printers, so the paper size should not execute such an operator if at all possible. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-T papersize</span> Set the paper size to the given pair of dimensions.  This option takes its arguments in the same style as <span Class="emphasis">-O .</span> It overrides any paper size special in the dvi file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-u psmapfile</span> Set <span Class="emphasis">psmapfile</span> to be the file that dvips uses for looking up PostScript font aliases.  If <span Class="emphasis">psmapfile</span> begins with a <span Class="bold">+</span> character, then the rest of the name is used as the name of the map file, and the map file is appended to the list of map files (instead of replacing the list).  In either case, if <span Class="emphasis">psmapfile</span> has no extension, then <span Class="bold">.map</span> is added at the end. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-U</span> Disable a PostScript virtual memory saving optimization that stores the character metric information in the same string that is used to store the bitmap information.  This is only necessary when driving the Xerox 4045 PostScript interpreter.  It is caused by a bug in that interpreter that results in `garbage' on the bottom of each character.  Not recommended unless you must drive this printer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Print the <span Class="bold">dvips</span> version number and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-V</span> Download non-resident PostScript fonts as bitmaps.  This requires use of `gsftopk' or `pstopk' or some other such program(s) in order to generate the required bitmap fonts; these programs are supplied with <span Class="manpage">dvips .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-x num</span> Set the magnification ratio to <span Class="emphasis">num /1000.</span> Overrides the magnification specified in the .dvi file.  Must be between 10 and 100000.  Instead of an integer, <span Class="emphasis">num</span> may be a real number for increased precision. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-X num</span> Set the horizontal resolution in dots per inch to <span Class="emphasis">num .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-y num</span> Set the magnification ratio to <span Class="emphasis">num /1000</span> times the magnification specified in the .dvi file. See <span Class="bold">-x</span> above. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Y num</span> Set the vertical resolution in dots per inch to <span Class="emphasis">num .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-z</span> Pass <span Class="bold">html</span> hyperdvi specials through to the output for eventual distillation into PDF.  This is not enabled by default to avoid including the header files unnecessarily, and use of temporary files in creating the output. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Z</span> Causes bitmapped fonts to be compressed before they are downloaded, thereby reducing the size of the PostScript font-downloading information.  Especially useful at high resolutions or when very large fonts are used.  Will slow down printing somewhat, especially on early 68000-based PostScript printers. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
