<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Gzip</span> reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension <span Class="manpage">\&.gz</span>while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification times. (The default extension is <span Class="bold">-gz</span> for VMS, <span Class="bold">z</span> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, Windows NT FAT and Atari.) If no files are specified, or if a file name is "-", the standard input is compressed to the standard output. <span Class="emphasis">Gzip</span> will only attempt to compress regular files. In particular, it will ignore symbolic links. 
<p class="level0">If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span> truncates it. <span Class="emphasis">Gzip</span> attempts to truncate only the parts of the file name longer than 3 characters. (A part is delimited by dots.) If the name consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For example, if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is compressed to gzi.msd.exe.gz. Names are not truncated on systems which do not have a limit on file name length. 
<p class="level0">By default, <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span> keeps the original file name and timestamp in the compressed file. These are used when decompressing the file with the <span Class="bold">-N</span> option. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated or when the time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer. 
<p class="level0">Compressed files can be restored to their original form using <span Class="emphasis">gzip -d</span> or <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> or <span Class="emphasis">zcat .</span> If the original name saved in the compressed file is not suitable for its file system, a new name is constructed from the original one to make it legal. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> takes a list of files on its command line and replaces each file whose name ends with .gz, -gz, .z, -z, or _z (ignoring case) and which begins with the correct magic number with an uncompressed file without the original extension. <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> also recognizes the special extensions <span Class="bold">\&.tgz</span> and <span Class="bold">\&.taz</span> as shorthands for <span Class="bold">\&.tar.gz</span> and <span Class="bold">\&.tar.Z</span> respectively. When compressing, <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span> uses the <span Class="bold">\&.tgz</span> extension if necessary instead of truncating a file with a <span Class="bold">\&.tar</span> extension. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> can currently decompress files created by <span Class="emphasis">gzip ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">zip ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">compress ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">compress -H</span> or <span Class="emphasis">pack .</span> The detection of the input format is automatic.  When using the first two formats, <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> checks a 32 bit CRC. For <span Class="emphasis">pack</span> and <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> checks the uncompressed length. The standard <span Class="emphasis">compress</span> format was not designed to allow consistency checks. However <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> is sometimes able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply because the standard <span Class="emphasis">uncompress</span> does not complain. This generally means that the standard <span Class="emphasis">uncompress</span> does not check its input, and happily generates garbage output. The SCO compress -H format (lzh compression method) does not include a CRC but also allows some consistency checks. 
<p class="level0">Files created by <span Class="emphasis">zip</span> can be uncompressed by gzip only if they have a single member compressed with the 'deflation' method. This feature is only intended to help conversion of tar.zip files to the tar.gz format.  To extract a <span Class="emphasis">zip</span> file with a single member, use a command like <span Class="emphasis">gunzip &lt;foo.zip</span> or <span Class="emphasis">gunzip -S .zip foo.zip .</span> To extract zip files with several members, use <span Class="emphasis">unzip</span> instead of <span Class="emphasis">gunzip .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">zcat</span> is identical to <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> <span Class="manpage">-c .</span>(On some systems, <span Class="emphasis">zcat</span> may be installed as <span Class="emphasis">gzcat</span> to preserve the original link to <span Class="emphasis">compress .)</span> <span Class="emphasis">zcat</span> uncompresses either a list of files on the command line or its standard input and writes the uncompressed data on standard output. <span Class="emphasis">zcat</span> will uncompress files that have the correct magic number whether they have a <span Class="bold">\&.gz</span> suffix or not. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Gzip</span> uses the Lempel-Ziv algorithm used in <span Class="emphasis">zip</span> and PKZIP. The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input and the distribution of common substrings. Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced by 60-70%. Compression is generally much better than that achieved by LZW (as used in <span Class="emphasis">compress ),</span> Huffman coding (as used in <span Class="emphasis">pack ),</span> or adaptive Huffman coding 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Compression is always performed, even if the compressed file is slightly larger than the original. The worst case expansion is a few bytes for the gzip file header, plus 5 bytes every 32K block, or an expansion ratio of 0.015% for large files. Note that the actual number of used disk blocks almost never increases. <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span> preserves the mode, ownership and timestamps of files when compressing or decompressing. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-a --ascii</span> Ascii text mode: convert end-of-lines using local conventions. This option is supported only on some non-Unix systems. For MSDOS, CR LF is converted to LF when compressing, and LF is converted to CR LF when decompressing. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-c --stdout --to-stdout</span> Write output on standard output; keep original files unchanged. If there are several input files, the output consists of a sequence of independently compressed members. To obtain better compression, concatenate all input files before compressing them. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d --decompress --uncompress</span> Decompress. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f --force</span> Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple links or the corresponding file already exists, or if the compressed data is read from or written to a terminal. If the input data is not in a format recognized by <span Class="emphasis">gzip ,</span> and if the option --stdout is also given, copy the input data without change to the standard output: let <span Class="emphasis">zcat</span> behave as <span Class="emphasis">cat .</span> If <span Class="bold">-f</span> is not given, and when not running in the background, <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span> prompts to verify whether an existing file should be overwritten. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-h --help</span> Display a help screen and quit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-k --keep</span> Keep (don't delete) input files during compression or decompression. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l --list</span> For each compressed file, list the following fields: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;   compressed size: size of the compressed file &nbsp;   uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file &nbsp;   ratio: compression ratio (0.0% if unknown) &nbsp;   uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file 
<p class="level0">The uncompressed size is given as -1 for files not in gzip format, such as compressed .Z files. To get the uncompressed size for such a file, you can use: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;   zcat file.Z | wc -c 
<p class="level0">In combination with the --verbose option, the following fields are also displayed: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;   method: compression method &nbsp;   crc: the 32-bit CRC of the uncompressed data &nbsp;   date & time: time stamp for the uncompressed file 
<p class="level0">The compression methods currently supported are deflate, compress, lzh (SCO compress -H) and pack.  The crc is given as ffffffff for a file not in gzip format. 
<p class="level0">With --name, the uncompressed name,  date and time  are those stored within the compress file if present. 
<p class="level0">With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio for all files is also displayed, unless some sizes are unknown. With --quiet, the title and totals lines are not displayed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-L --license</span> Display the <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span> license and quit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-n --no-name</span> When compressing, do not save the original file name and time stamp by default. (The original name is always saved if the name had to be truncated.) When decompressing, do not restore the original file name if present (remove only the <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span> suffix from the compressed file name) and do not restore the original time stamp if present (copy it from the compressed file). This option is the default when decompressing. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-N --name</span> When compressing, always save the original file name and time stamp; this is the default. When decompressing, restore the original file name and time stamp if present. This option is useful on systems which have a limit on file name length or when the time stamp has been lost after a file transfer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-q --quiet</span> Suppress all warnings. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-r --recursive</span> Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file names specified on the command line are directories, <span Class="emphasis">gzip</span> will descend into the directory and compress all the files it finds there (or decompress them in the case of <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> ). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--rsyncable</span> While compressing, synchronize the output occasionally based on the input. This increases size by less than 1 percent most cases, but means that the , <span Class="manpage">rsync (1)</span>program can take advantage of similarities in the uncompressed input when synchronizing two files compressed with this flag. <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> cannot tell the difference between a compressed file created with this option, and one created without it. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-S .suf   --suffix .suf</span> When compressing, use suffix .suf instead of .gz. Any non-empty suffix can be given, but suffixes other than .z and .gz should be avoided to avoid confusion when files are transferred to other systems. 
<p class="level0">When decompressing, add .suf to the beginning of the list of suffixes to try, when deriving an output file name from an input file name. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t --test</span> Test. Check the compressed file integrity. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v --verbose</span> Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed or decompressed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-V --version</span> Version. Display the version number and compilation options then quit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-# --fast --best</span> Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit <span Class="emphasis"># ,</span> where <span Class="bold">-1</span> or <span Class="bold">--fast</span> indicates the fastest compression method (less compression) and <span Class="bold">-9</span> or <span Class="bold">--best</span> indicates the slowest compression method (best compression). The default compression level is <span Class="manpage">-6</span>(that is, biased towards high compression at expense of speed). <a name="ADVANCED"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ADVANCED USAGE</h2>
<p class="level0">Multiple compressed files can be concatenated. In this case, <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> will extract all members at once. For example: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;     gzip -c file1  &gt; foo.gz &nbsp;     gzip -c file2 &gt;&gt; foo.gz 
<p class="level0">Then 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;     gunzip -c foo 
<p class="level0">is equivalent to 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;     cat file1 file2 
<p class="level0">In case of damage to one member of a .gz file, other members can still be recovered (if the damaged member is removed). However, you can get better compression by compressing all members at once: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;     cat file1 file2 | gzip &gt; foo.gz 
<p class="level0">compresses better than 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;     gzip -c file1 file2 &gt; foo.gz 
<p class="level0">If you want to recompress concatenated files to get better compression, do: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;     gzip -cd old.gz | gzip &gt; new.gz 
<p class="level0">If a compressed file consists of several members, the uncompressed size and CRC reported by the --list option applies to the last member only. If you need the uncompressed size for all members, you can use: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;     gzip -cd file.gz | wc -c 
<p class="level0">If you wish to create a single archive file with multiple members so that members can later be extracted independently, use an archiver such as tar or zip. GNU tar supports the -z option to invoke gzip transparently. gzip is designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement. <a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">The environment variable <span Class="bold">GZIP</span> can hold a set of default options for <span Class="emphasis">gzip .</span> These options are interpreted first and can be overwritten by explicit command line parameters. For example: &nbsp;     for sh:    GZIP="-8v --name"; export GZIP &nbsp;     for csh:   setenv GZIP "-8v --name" &nbsp;     for MSDOS: set GZIP=-8v --name 
<p class="level0">On Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is GZIP_OPT, to avoid a conflict with the symbol set for invocation of the program. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>

<p class="level0">When writing compressed data to a tape, it is generally necessary to pad the output with zeroes up to a block boundary. When the data is read and the whole block is passed to <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> for decompression, <span Class="emphasis">gunzip</span> detects that there is extra trailing garbage after the compressed data and emits a warning by default. You have to use the --quiet option to suppress the warning. This option can be set in the <span Class="bold">GZIP</span> environment variable as in: &nbsp; for sh:  GZIP="-q"  tar -xfz --block-compress /dev/rst0 &nbsp; for csh: (setenv GZIP -q; tar -xfz --block-compr /dev/rst0 
<p class="level0">In the above example, gzip is invoked implicitly by the -z option of GNU tar. Make sure that the same block size (-b option of tar) is used for reading and writing compressed data on tapes.  (This example assumes you are using the GNU version of tar.) <a name="BUGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">BUGS</h2>
<p class="level0">The gzip format represents the input size modulo 2^32, so the --list option reports incorrect uncompressed sizes and compression ratios for uncompressed files 4 GB and larger.  To work around this problem, you can use the following command to discover a large uncompressed file's true size: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;     zcat file.gz | wc -c 
<p class="level0">The --list option reports sizes as -1 and crc as ffffffff if the compressed file is on a non seekable media. 
<p class="level0">In some rare cases, the --best option gives worse compression than the default compression level (-6). On some highly redundant files, <span Class="emphasis">compress</span> compresses better than <span Class="emphasis">gzip .</span> <a name="COPYRIGHT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COPYRIGHT NOTICE</h2>
