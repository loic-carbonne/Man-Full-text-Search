<p class="level0"><a name="Operation"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Operation</h2>
<p class="level0">When operating *(We, the two most important keys are the help ('h' or '?') key and quit ('q') key. Alternatively, you could simply use the traditional interrupt key ('^C') when you're done. 
<p class="level0">When started for the first time, you'll be presented with these traditional elements on the main *(We screen: 1) Summary Area; 2) Fields/Columns Header; 3) Task Area. Each of these will be explored in the sections that follow. There is also an Input/Message line between the Summary Area and Columns Header which needs no further explanation. 
<p class="level0">The main *(We screen is <span Class="emphasis">generally</span> quite adaptive to changes in terminal dimensions under X-Windows. Other *(We screens may be less so, especially those with static text. It ultimately depends, however, on your particular window manager and terminal emulator. There may be occasions when their view of terminal size and current contents differs from *(We's view, which is always based on operating system calls. 
<p class="level0">Following any re-size operation, if a *(We screen is corrupted, appears incomplete or disordered, simply typing something innocuous like a punctuation character or cursor motion key will usually restore it. In extreme cases, the following sequence almost certainly will: <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;      <span class="emphasis">key/cmd  objective </span>
&nbsp;      ^Z       <span class="bold">suspend</span> *(We
&nbsp;      fg       <span class="bold">resume</span> *(We
&nbsp;      &lt;Left&gt;   force a screen <span class="bold">redraw</span> (if necessary)
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">But if the display is still corrupted, there is one more step you could try. Insert this command after *(We has been suspended but before resuming it. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;      <span class="emphasis">key/cmd  objective </span>
&nbsp;      reset    restore your <span class="bold">terminal settings</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">*(NT the width of *(We's display will be limited to *(WX positions. Displaying all fields requires *(WF characters. Remaining screen width is usually allocated to any variable width columns currently visible. The variable width columns, such as COMMAND, are noted in topic 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields. Actual output width may also be influenced by the -w switch, which is discussed in topic 1. COMMAND-LINE Options. 
<p class="level0">Lastly, some of *(We's screens or functions require the use of cursor motion keys like the standard *(KAs plus the Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys. If your terminal or emulator does not provide those keys, the following combinations are accepted as alternatives: <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;     <span class="emphasis"> key      equivalent-key-combinations </span>
&nbsp;      Up       alt +<span class="bold"> \</span>      or  alt +<span class="bold"> k </span>
&nbsp;      Down     alt +<span class="bold"> /</span>      or  alt +<span class="bold"> j </span>
&nbsp;      Left     alt +<span class="bold"> &lt;</span>      or  alt +<span class="bold"> h </span>
&nbsp;      Right    alt +<span class="bold"> &gt;</span>      or  alt +<span class="bold"> l </span>(lower case L)
&nbsp;      PgUp     alt +<span class="bold"> Up</span>     or  alt + ctrl +<span class="bold"> k </span>
&nbsp;      PgDn     alt +<span class="bold"> Down</span>   or  alt + ctrl +<span class="bold"> j </span>
&nbsp;      Home     alt +<span class="bold"> Left</span>   or  alt + ctrl +<span class="bold"> h </span>
&nbsp;      End      alt +<span class="bold"> Right</span>  or  alt + ctrl +<span class="bold"> l </span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">Up</span> and <span Class="bold">Down</span> *(KAs have special significance when prompted for line input terminated with the &lt;Enter&gt; key. Those keys, or their aliases, can be used to retrieve previous input lines which can then be edited and re-input. And there are four additional keys available with line oriented input. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;     <span class="emphasis"> key      special-significance </span>
&nbsp;      Up       recall <span class="bold">older</span> strings for re-editing
&nbsp;      Down     recall <span class="bold">newer</span> strings or <span class="bold">erase</span> entire line

<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">Input Requirements</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When prompted for selection criteria, the data you provide must take one of two forms. There are 3 required pieces of information, with a 4th as optional. These examples use spaces for clarity but your input generally would not. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;       &#35;1           <span class="bold">&#35;2</span>  &#35;3              ( required )
&nbsp;       Field-Name   ?   include-if-value
&nbsp;    <span class="bold">!</span>  Field-Name   ?   <span class="bold">exclude</span>-if-value
&nbsp;    &#35;4                                  ( optional )
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Items &#35;1, &#35;3 and &#35;4 should be self-explanatory. Item <span Class="bold">&#35;2</span> represents both a required <span Class="emphasis">delimiter</span> and the <span Class="emphasis">operator</span> which must be one of either equality ('=') or relation ('&lt;' or '&gt;'). 
<p class="level0">The '=' equality operator requires only a partial match and that can reduce your 'if-value' input requirements. The '&gt;' or '&lt;' relational operators always employ string comparisons, even with numeric fields. They are designed to work with a field's default <span Class="emphasis">justification</span> and with homogeneous data. When some field's numeric amounts have been subjected to <span Class="emphasis">scaling</span> while others have not, that data is no longer homogeneous. 
<p class="level0">If you establish a relational filter and you <span Class="bold">have</span> changed the default 'Numeric' or 'Character' <span Class="emphasis">justification</span>, that filter is likely to fail. When a relational filter is applied to a memory field and you <span Class="bold">have not</span> changed the <span Class="emphasis">scaling</span>, it may produce misleading results. This happens, for example, because '100.0m' (MiB) would appear greater than '1.000g' (GiB) when compared as strings. 
<p class="level0">If your filtered results appear suspect, simply altering justification or scaling may yet achieve the desired objective. See the 'j', 'J' and 'e' *(CIs for additional information. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">Potential Problems</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">These <span Class="bold">GROUP</span> filters could produce the exact same results or the second one might not display anything at all, just a blank *(TW. <pre class="level0">

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Either of these <span Class="bold">RES</span> filters might yield inconsistent and/or misleading results, depending on the current memory scaling factor. Or both filters could produce the exact same results. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;    RES&gt;9999          ( only the same results when )
&nbsp;    !RES&lt;10000        ( memory scaling is at 'KiB' )
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This <span Class="bold">nMin</span> filter illustrates a problem unique to scalable fields. This particular field can display a maximum of 4 digits, beyond which values are automatically scaled to KiB or above. So while amounts greater than 9999 exist, they will appear as 2.6m, 197k, etc. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;    nMin&gt;9999         ( always a blank *(TW )

<p class="level0">
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">Potential Solutions</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">These examples illustrate how 'Other Filtering' can be creatively applied to achieve almost any desired result. Single quotes are sometimes shown to delimit the spaces which are part of a filter or to represent a request for status (^O) accurately. But if you used them with if-values in real life, no matches would be found. 
<p class="level0">Assuming field <span Class="bold">nTH</span> is displayed, the first filter will result in only multi-threaded processes being shown. It also reminds us that a trailing space is part of every displayed field. The second filter achieves the exact same results with less typing. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;    !nTH=' 1 '                ( ' for clarity only )
&nbsp;    nTH&gt;1                     ( same with less i/p )
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">With Forest View mode active and the <span Class="bold">COMMAND</span> column in view, this filter effectively collapses child processes so that just 3 levels are shown. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;    !COMMAND='       `- '     ( ' for clarity only )
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The final two filters appear as in response to the status request key (^O). In reality, each filter would have required separate input. The <span Class="bold">PR</span> example shows the two concurrent filters necessary to display tasks with priorities of 20 or more, since some might be negative. Then by exploiting trailing spaces, the <span Class="bold">nMin</span> series of filters could achieve the failed '9999' objective discussed above. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;    'PR&gt;20' + '!PR=-'         ( 2 for right result )

<p class="level0">To exploit the 'Y' *(CI, you must add entries at the<span Class="bold"> end</span> of the *(We personal *(CF. Such entries simply reflect a file to be read or command/pipeline to be executed whose results will then be displayed in a separate scrollable, searchable window. 
<p class="level0">If you don't know the location or name of your *(We rcfile, use the 'W' *(CI to rewrite it and note those details. 
<p class="level0">Inspect entries can be added with a redirected echo or by editing the *(CF. Redirecting an echo risks overwriting the rcfile should it replace (&gt;) rather than append (&gt;&gt;) to that file. Conversely, when using an editor care must be taken not to corrupt existing lines, some of which will contain unprintable data or unusual characters. 
<p class="level0">Those Inspect entries beginning with a '&#35;' character are ignored, regardless of content. Otherwise they consist of the following 3 elements, each of which<span Class="emphasis"> must</span> be separated by a tab character (thus 2 '\t' total): 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; .type:  literal 'file' or 'pipe'
&nbsp; .name:  selection shown on the Inspect screen
&nbsp; .fmts:  string representing a path or command
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The two types of Inspect entries are<span Class="emphasis"> not</span> interchangeable. Those designated '<span Class="bold">file</span>' will be accessed using fopen and must reference a single file in the '.fmts' element. Entries specifying '<span Class="bold">pipe</span>' will employ popen, their '.fmts' element could contain many pipelined commands and, none can be interactive. 
<p class="level0">If the file or pipeline represented in your '.fmts' deals with the specific PID input or accepted when prompted, then the format string must also contain the '<span Class="bold">%d</span>' specifier, as these examples illustrate. 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; .fmts=  /proc/<span class="emphasis">%d</span>/numa_maps
&nbsp; .fmts=  lsof -P -p<span class="emphasis"> %d</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">For '<span Class="bold">pipe</span>' type entries only, you may also wish to redirect stderr to stdout for a more comprehensive result. Thus the format string becomes: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; .fmts=  pmap -x %d<span class="emphasis"> 2&gt;&1</span>
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Here are examples of both types of Inspect entries as they might appear in the rcfile. The first entry will be ignored due to the initial '&#35;' character. For clarity, the pseudo tab depictions (^I) are surrounded by an extra space but the actual tabs would not be. <pre class="level0">
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &#35; pipe ^I Sockets ^I lsof -n -P -i 2&gt;&1
&nbsp; pipe ^I Open Files ^I lsof -P -p %d 2&gt;&1
&nbsp; file ^I NUMA Info ^I /proc/%d/numa_maps
&nbsp; pipe ^I Log ^I tail -n100 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Except for the commented entry above, these next examples show what could be echoed to achieve similar results, assuming the rcfile name was '.toprc'. However, due to the embedded tab characters, each of these lines should be preceded by '<span Class="bold">/bin/echo -e</span>', not just a simple an 'echo', to enable backslash interpretation regardless of which shell you use. 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; "pipe\tOpen Files\tlsof -P -p %d 2&gt;&1" &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
&nbsp; "file\tNUMA Info\t/proc/%d/numa_maps" &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
&nbsp; "pipe\tLog\ttail -n200 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr" &gt;&gt; ~/.toprc
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Caution</span>: If any inspect entry you create produces output with unprintable characters they will be displayed in either the ^C notation or hexadecimal &lt;FF&gt; form, depending on their value. This applies to tab characters as well, which will show as '^I'. If you want a truer representation, any embedded tabs should be expanded. 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; &#35; next would have contained '\t' ...
&nbsp; &#35; file ^I &lt;your_name&gt; ^I /proc/%d/status
&nbsp; &#35; but this will eliminate embedded '\t' ...
&nbsp; pipe ^I &lt;your_name&gt; ^I cat /proc/%d/status | expand -
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The above example takes what could have been a 'file' entry but employs a 'pipe' instead so as to expand the embedded tabs. 
<p class="level0">*(NT While '<span Class="bold">pipe</span>' type entries have been discussed in terms of pipelines and commands, there is nothing to prevent you from including <span Class="emphasis"> shell scripts</span> as well. Perhaps even newly created scripts designed specifically for the 'Y' *(CI. 
<p class="level0">Lastly, as the number of your Inspect entries grows over time, the 'Options:' row will be truncated when screen width is exceeded. That does not affect operation other than to make some selections invisible. 
<p class="level0">However, if some choices are lost to truncation but you want to see more options, there is an easy solution hinted at below. 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; Inspection Pause at pid ...
&nbsp; Use:  left/right then &lt;Enter&gt; ...
&nbsp; Options:  help  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 ...
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The entries in the *(We rcfile would have a number for the '.name' element and the 'help' entry would identify a shell script you've written explaining what those numbered selections actually mean. In that way, many more choices can be made visible.

<p class="level0">Display all 4 windows and for each, in turn, set idle processes to *F using the 'i' *(CT. You've just entered the "extreme bounce" zone.

<p class="level0">This stupid trick also requires *(AM. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Display all 4 windows and make sure that 1:Def is the *(CW. Then, keep increasing window size with the 'n' *(CI until all the other *(TDs are "pushed out of the nest". 
<p class="level0">When they've all been displaced, toggle between all visible/invisible windows using the '_' *(CT. Then ponder this: <br>&nbsp;  is *(We fibbing or telling honestly your imposed truth?

<p class="level0">This stupid trick works best without *(AM, since justification is active on a per window basis. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Start *(We and make COMMAND the last (rightmost) column displayed. If necessary, use the 'c' *(CT to display command lines and ensure that forest view mode is active with the 'V' *(CT. 
<p class="level0">Then use the up/down arrow keys to position the display so that some truncated command lines are shown ('+' in last position). You may have to resize your xterm to produce truncation. 
<p class="level0">Lastly, use the 'j' *(CT to make the COMMAND column right justified. 
<p class="level0">Now use the right arrow key to reach the COMMAND column. Continuing with the right arrow key, watch closely the direction of travel for the command lines being shown. 
<p class="level0"><br>&nbsp;  some lines travel left, while others travel right 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;  eventually all lines will Switcheroo, and move right
