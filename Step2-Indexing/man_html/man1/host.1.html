<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">host</span> is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa. When no arguments or options are given, <span Class="bold">host</span> prints a short summary of its command line arguments and options. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">name</span> is the domain name that is to be looked up. It can also be a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a colon-delimited IPv6 address, in which case <span Class="bold">host</span> will by default perform a reverse lookup for that address. <span Class="emphasis">server</span> is an optional argument which is either the name or IP address of the name server that <span Class="bold">host</span> should query instead of the server or servers listed in <span Class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</span>. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-a</span> (all) option is equivalent to setting the <span Class="bold">-v</span> option and asking <span Class="bold">host</span> to make a query of type ANY. 
<p class="level0">When the <span Class="bold">-C</span> option is used, <span Class="bold">host</span> will attempt to display the SOA records for zone <span Class="emphasis">name</span> from all the listed authoritative name servers for that zone. The list of name servers is defined by the NS records that are found for the zone. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-c</span> option instructs to make a DNS query of class <span Class="emphasis">class</span>. This can be used to lookup Hesiod or Chaosnet class resource records. The default class is IN (Internet). 
<p class="level0">Verbose output is generated by <span Class="bold">host</span> when the <span Class="bold">-d</span> or <span Class="bold">-v</span> option is used. The two options are equivalent. They have been provided for backwards compatibility. In previous versions, the <span Class="bold">-d</span> option switched on debugging traces and <span Class="bold">-v</span> enabled verbose output. 
<p class="level0">List mode is selected by the <span Class="bold">-l</span> option. This makes <span Class="bold">host</span> perform a zone transfer for zone <span Class="emphasis">name</span>. Transfer the zone printing out the NS, PTR and address records (A/AAAA). If combined with <span Class="bold">-a</span> all records will be printed. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-i</span> option specifies that reverse lookups of IPv6 addresses should use the IP6.INT domain as defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1886.txt">RFC 1886</a>. The default is to use IP6.ARPA. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-N</span> option sets the number of dots that have to be in <span Class="emphasis">name</span> for it to be considered absolute. The default value is that defined using the ndots statement in <span Class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</span>, or 1 if no ndots statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names and will be searched for in the domains listed in the <span Class="bold">search</span> or <span Class="bold">domain</span> directive in <span Class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</span>. 
<p class="level0">The number of UDP retries for a lookup can be changed with the <span Class="bold">-R</span> option. <span Class="emphasis">number</span> indicates how many times <span Class="bold">host</span> will repeat a query that does not get answered. The default number of retries is 1. If <span Class="emphasis">number</span> is negative or zero, the number of retries will default to 1. 
<p class="level0">Non-recursive queries can be made via the <span Class="bold">-r</span> option. Setting this option clears the <span Class="bold">RD</span> (em recursion desired (em bit in the query which <span Class="bold">host</span> makes. This should mean that the name server receiving the query will not attempt to resolve <span Class="emphasis">name</span>. The <span Class="bold">-r</span> option enables <span Class="bold">host</span> to mimic the behavior of a name server by making non-recursive queries and expecting to receive answers to those queries that are usually referrals to other name servers. 
<p class="level0">By default, <span Class="bold">host</span> uses UDP when making queries. The <span Class="bold">-T</span> option makes it use a TCP connection when querying the name server. TCP will be automatically selected for queries that require it, such as zone transfer (AXFR) requests. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-4</span> option forces <span Class="bold">host</span> to only use IPv4 query transport. The <span Class="bold">-6</span> option forces <span Class="bold">host</span> to only use IPv6 query transport. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-t</span> option is used to select the query type. <span Class="emphasis">type</span> can be any recognized query type: CNAME, NS, SOA, SIG, KEY, AXFR, etc. When no query type is specified, <span Class="bold">host</span> automatically selects an appropriate query type. By default, it looks for A, AAAA, and MX records, but if the <span Class="bold">-C</span> option was given, queries will be made for SOA records, and if <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or colon-delimited IPv6 address, <span Class="bold">host</span> will query for PTR records. If a query type of IXFR is chosen the starting serial number can be specified by appending an equal followed by the starting serial number (e.g. -t IXFR=12345678). 
<p class="level0">The time to wait for a reply can be controlled through the <span Class="bold">-W</span> and <span Class="bold">-w</span> options. The <span Class="bold">-W</span> option makes <span Class="bold">host</span> wait for <span Class="emphasis">wait</span> seconds. If <span Class="emphasis">wait</span> is less than one, the wait interval is set to one second. When the <span Class="bold">-w</span> option is used, <span Class="bold">host</span> will effectively wait forever for a reply. The time to wait for a response will be set to the number of seconds given by the hardware's maximum value for an integer quantity. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-s</span> option tells <span Class="bold">host</span> <span Class="emphasis">not</span> to send the query to the next nameserver if any server responds with a SERVFAIL response, which is the reverse of normal stub resolver behavior. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-m</span> can be used to set the memory usage debugging flags <span Class="emphasis">record</span>, <span Class="emphasis">usage</span> and <span Class="emphasis">trace</span>. <a name="IDN"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">IDN SUPPORT</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If <span Class="bold">host</span> has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support, it can accept and display non-ASCII domain names. <span Class="bold">host</span> appropriately converts character encoding of domain name before sending a request to DNS server or displaying a reply from the server. If you'd like to turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the <span Class="bold">IDN_DISABLE</span> environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the variable is set when <span Class="bold">host</span> runs. <a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>
