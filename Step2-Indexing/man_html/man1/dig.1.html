<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dig</span> (domain information groper) is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use <span Class="bold">dig</span> to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than <span Class="bold">dig</span>. 
<p class="level0">Although <span Class="bold">dig</span> is normally used with command-line arguments, it also has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed when the <span Class="bold">-h</span> option is given. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9 implementation of <span Class="bold">dig</span> allows multiple lookups to be issued from the command line. 
<p class="level0">Unless it is told to query a specific name server, <span Class="bold">dig</span> will try each of the servers listed in <span Class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</span>. If no usable server addresses are found, <span Class="bold">dig</span> will send the query to the local host. 
<p class="level0">When no command line arguments or options are given, <span Class="bold">dig</span> will perform an NS query for "." (the root). 
<p class="level0">It is possible to set per-user defaults for <span Class="bold">dig</span> via <span Class="emphasis">${HOME}/.digrc</span>. This file is read and any options in it are applied before the command line arguments. 
<p class="level0">The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top level domains names. Either use the <span Class="bold">-t</span> and <span Class="bold">-c</span> options to specify the type and class, use the <span Class="bold">-q</span> the specify the domain name, or use "IN." and "CH." when looking up these top level domains. <a name="SIMPLE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SIMPLE USAGE</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A typical invocation of <span Class="bold">dig</span> looks like: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
&nbsp;dig @server name type 
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">where: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">server</span> 
<p class="level1">is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon-delimited notation. When the supplied <span Class="emphasis">server</span> argument is a hostname, <span Class="bold">dig</span> resolves that name before querying that name server. 
<p class="level1">If no <span Class="emphasis">server</span> argument is provided, <span Class="bold">dig</span> consults <span Class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</span>; if an address is found there, it queries the name server at that address. If either of the <span Class="bold">-4</span> or <span Class="bold">-6</span> options are in use, then only addresses for the corresponding transport will be tried. If no usable addresses are found, <span Class="bold">dig</span> will send the query to the local host. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">name</span> 
<p class="level1">is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">type</span> 
<p class="level1">indicates what type of query is required (em ANY, A, MX, SIG, etc. <span Class="emphasis">type</span> can be any valid query type. If no <span Class="emphasis">type</span> argument is supplied, <span Class="bold">dig</span> will perform a lookup for an A record. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-b</span> option sets the source IP address of the query to <span Class="emphasis">address</span>. This must be a valid address on one of the host's network interfaces or "0.0.0.0" or "::". An optional port may be specified by appending "&#35;&lt;port&gt;" 
<p class="level0">The default query class (IN for internet) is overridden by the <span Class="bold">-c</span> option. <span Class="emphasis">class</span> is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod records or CH for Chaosnet records. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-f</span> option makes <span Class="bold">dig </span> operate in batch mode by reading a list of lookup requests to process from the file <span Class="emphasis">filename</span>. The file contains a number of queries, one per line. Each entry in the file should be organized in the same way they would be presented as queries to <span Class="bold">dig</span> using the command-line interface. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-m</span> option enables memory usage debugging. 
<p class="level0">If a non-standard port number is to be queried, the <span Class="bold">-p</span> option is used. <span Class="emphasis">port&#35;</span> is the port number that <span Class="bold">dig</span> will send its queries instead of the standard DNS port number 53. This option would be used to test a name server that has been configured to listen for queries on a non-standard port number. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-4</span> option forces <span Class="bold">dig</span> to only use IPv4 query transport. The <span Class="bold">-6</span> option forces <span Class="bold">dig</span> to only use IPv6 query transport. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-t</span> option sets the query type to <span Class="emphasis">type</span>. It can be any valid query type which is supported in BIND 9. The default query type is "A", unless the <span Class="bold">-x</span> option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup. A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, <span Class="emphasis">type</span> is set to ixfr=N. The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the serial number in the zone's SOA record was <span Class="emphasis">N</span>. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-q</span> option sets the query name to <span Class="emphasis">name</span>. This useful do distinguish the <span Class="emphasis">name</span> from other arguments. 
<p class="level0">Reverse lookups (em mapping addresses to names (em are simplified by the <span Class="bold">-x</span> option. <span Class="emphasis">addr</span> is an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When this option is used, there is no need to provide the <span Class="emphasis">name</span>, <span Class="emphasis">class</span> and <span Class="emphasis">type</span> arguments. <span Class="bold">dig</span> automatically performs a lookup for a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type and class to PTR and IN respectively. By default, IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain. To use the older <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1886.txt">RFC 1886</a> method using the IP6.INT domain specify the <span Class="bold">-i</span> option. Bit string labels (RFC2874) are now experimental and are not attempted. 
<p class="level0">To sign the DNS queries sent by <span Class="bold">dig</span> and their responses using transaction signatures (TSIG), specify a TSIG key file using the <span Class="bold">-k</span> option. You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command line using the <span Class="bold">-y</span> option; <span Class="emphasis">hmac</span> is the type of the TSIG, default HMAC-MD5, <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is the name of the TSIG key and <span Class="emphasis">key</span> is the actual key. The key is a base-64 encoded string, typically generated by <span Class="bold">dnssec-keygen</span>(8). Caution should be taken when using the <span Class="bold">-y</span> option on multi-user systems as the key can be visible in the output from <span Class="bold">ps</span>(1) or in the shell's history file. When using TSIG authentication with <span Class="bold">dig</span>, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing appropriate <span Class="bold">key</span> and <span Class="bold">server</span> statements in <span Class="emphasis">named.conf</span>. <a name="QUERY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">QUERY OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dig</span> provides a number of query options which affect the way in which lookups are made and the results displayed. Some of these set or reset flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry strategies. 
<p class="level0">Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign (+). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by the string no to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords assign values to options like the timeout interval. They have the form <span Class="bold">+keyword=value</span>. The query options are: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]tcp</span> 
<p class="level1">Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. The default behavior is to use UDP unless an AXFR or IXFR query is requested, in which case a TCP connection is used. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]vc</span> 
<p class="level1">Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. This alternate syntax to <span Class="emphasis">+[no]tcp</span> is provided for backwards compatibility. The "vc" stands for "virtual circuit". 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]ignore</span> 
<p class="level1">Ignore truncation in UDP responses instead of retrying with TCP. By default, TCP retries are performed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+domain=somename</span> 
<p class="level1">Set the search list to contain the single domain <span Class="emphasis">somename</span>, as if specified in a <span Class="bold">domain</span> directive in <span Class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</span>, and enable search list processing as if the <span Class="emphasis">+search</span> option were given. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]search</span> 
<p class="level1">Use [do not use] the search list defined by the searchlist or domain directive in <span Class="emphasis">resolv.conf</span> (if any). The search list is not used by default. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]showsearch</span> 
<p class="level1">Perform [do not perform] a search showing intermediate results. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]defname</span> 
<p class="level1">Deprecated, treated as a synonym for <span Class="emphasis">+[no]search</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]aaonly</span> 
<p class="level1">Sets the "aa" flag in the query. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]aaflag</span> 
<p class="level1">A synonym for <span Class="emphasis">+[no]aaonly</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]adflag</span> 
<p class="level1">Set [do not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the query. This requests the server to return whether all of the answer and authority sections have all been validated as secure according to the security policy of the server. AD=1 indicates that all records have been validated as secure and the answer is not from a OPT-OUT range. AD=0 indicate that some part of the answer was insecure or not validated. This bit is set by default. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]cdflag</span> 
<p class="level1">Set [do not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit in the query. This requests the server to not perform DNSSEC validation of responses. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]cl</span> 
<p class="level1">Display [do not display] the CLASS when printing the record. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]ttlid</span> 
<p class="level1">Display [do not display] the TTL when printing the record. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]recurse</span> 
<p class="level1">Toggle the setting of the RD (recursion desired) bit in the query. This bit is set by default, which means <span Class="bold">dig</span> normally sends recursive queries. Recursion is automatically disabled when the <span Class="emphasis">+nssearch</span> or <span Class="emphasis">+trace</span> query options are used. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]nssearch</span> 
<p class="level1">When this option is set, <span Class="bold">dig</span> attempts to find the authoritative name servers for the zone containing the name being looked up and display the SOA record that each name server has for the zone. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]trace</span> 
<p class="level1">Toggle tracing of the delegation path from the root name servers for the name being looked up. Tracing is disabled by default. When tracing is enabled, <span Class="bold">dig</span> makes iterative queries to resolve the name being looked up. It will follow referrals from the root servers, showing the answer from each server that was used to resolve the lookup. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+dnssec</span> is also set when +trace is set to better emulate the default queries from a nameserver. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]cmd</span> 
<p class="level1">Toggles the printing of the initial comment in the output identifying the version of <span Class="bold">dig</span> and the query options that have been applied. This comment is printed by default. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]short</span> 
<p class="level1">Provide a terse answer. The default is to print the answer in a verbose form. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]identify</span> 
<p class="level1">Show [or do not show] the IP address and port number that supplied the answer when the <span Class="emphasis">+short</span> option is enabled. If short form answers are requested, the default is not to show the source address and port number of the server that provided the answer. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]comments</span> 
<p class="level1">Toggle the display of comment lines in the output. The default is to print comments. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]rrcomments</span> 
<p class="level1">Toggle the display of per-record comments in the output (for example, human-readable key information about DNSKEY records). The default is not to print record comments unless multiline mode is active. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+split=W</span> 
<p class="level1">Split long hex- or base64-formatted fields in resource records into chunks of <span Class="emphasis">W</span> characters (where <span Class="emphasis">W</span> is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 4). <span Class="emphasis">+nosplit</span> or <span Class="emphasis">+split=0</span> causes fields not to be split at all. The default is 56 characters, or 44 characters when multiline mode is active. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]stats</span> 
<p class="level1">This query option toggles the printing of statistics: when the query was made, the size of the reply and so on. The default behavior is to print the query statistics. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]qr</span> 
<p class="level1">Print [do not print] the query as it is sent. By default, the query is not printed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]question</span> 
<p class="level1">Print [do not print] the question section of a query when an answer is returned. The default is to print the question section as a comment. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]answer</span> 
<p class="level1">Display [do not display] the answer section of a reply. The default is to display it. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]authority</span> 
<p class="level1">Display [do not display] the authority section of a reply. The default is to display it. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]additional</span> 
<p class="level1">Display [do not display] the additional section of a reply. The default is to display it. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]all</span> 
<p class="level1">Set or clear all display flags. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+time=T</span> 
<p class="level1">Sets the timeout for a query to <span Class="emphasis">T</span> seconds. The default timeout is 5 seconds. An attempt to set <span Class="emphasis">T</span> to less than 1 will result in a query timeout of 1 second being applied. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+tries=T</span> 
<p class="level1">Sets the number of times to try UDP queries to server to <span Class="emphasis">T</span> instead of the default, 3. If <span Class="emphasis">T</span> is less than or equal to zero, the number of tries is silently rounded up to 1. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+retry=T</span> 
<p class="level1">Sets the number of times to retry UDP queries to server to <span Class="emphasis">T</span> instead of the default, 2. Unlike <span Class="emphasis">+tries</span>, this does not include the initial query. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+ndots=D</span> 
<p class="level1">Set the number of dots that have to appear in <span Class="emphasis">name</span> to <span Class="emphasis">D</span> for it to be considered absolute. The default value is that defined using the ndots statement in <span Class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</span>, or 1 if no ndots statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names and will be searched for in the domains listed in the <span Class="bold">search</span> or <span Class="bold">domain</span> directive in <span Class="emphasis">/etc/resolv.conf</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+bufsize=B</span> 
<p class="level1">Set the UDP message buffer size advertised using EDNS0 to <span Class="emphasis">B</span> bytes. The maximum and minimum sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0 respectively. Values outside this range are rounded up or down appropriately. Values other than zero will cause a EDNS query to be sent. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+edns=&#35;</span> 
<p class="level1">Specify the EDNS version to query with. Valid values are 0 to 255. Setting the EDNS version will cause a EDNS query to be sent. <span Class="bold">+noedns</span> clears the remembered EDNS version. EDNS is set to 0 by default. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]multiline</span> 
<p class="level1">Print records like the SOA records in a verbose multi-line format with human-readable comments. The default is to print each record on a single line, to facilitate machine parsing of the <span Class="bold">dig</span> output.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]onesoa</span> 
<p class="level1">Print only one (starting) SOA record when performing an AXFR. The default is to print both the starting and ending SOA records. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]fail</span> 
<p class="level1">Do not try the next server if you receive a SERVFAIL. The default is to not try the next server which is the reverse of normal stub resolver behavior. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]besteffort</span> 
<p class="level1">Attempt to display the contents of messages which are malformed. The default is to not display malformed answers.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+[no]keepopen</span> 
<p class="level1">Keep the TCP socket open between queries and reuse it rather than creating a new TCP socket for each lookup. The default is <span Class="bold">+nokeepopen</span>. 
<p class="level0"><a name="MULTIPLE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">MULTIPLE QUERIES</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The BIND 9 implementation of <span Class="bold">dig </span> supports specifying multiple queries on the command line (in addition to supporting the <span Class="bold">-f</span> batch file option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its own set of flags, options and query options. 
<p class="level0">In this case, each <span Class="emphasis">query</span> argument represent an individual query in the command-line syntax described above. Each consists of any of the standard options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query type and class and any query options that should be applied to that query. 
<p class="level0">A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries, can also be supplied. These global query options must precede the first tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied on the command line. Any global query options (except the <span Class="bold">+[no]cmd</span> option) can be overridden by a query-specific set of query options. For example: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
dig +qr www.isc.org any -x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr
</pre>

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">shows how <span Class="bold">dig</span> could be used from the command line to make three lookups: an ANY query for www.isc.org, a reverse lookup of 127.0.0.1 and a query for the NS records of isc.org. A global query option of <span Class="emphasis">+qr</span> is applied, so that <span Class="bold">dig</span> shows the initial query it made for each lookup. The final query has a local query option of <span Class="emphasis">+noqr</span> which means that <span Class="bold">dig</span> will not print the initial query when it looks up the NS records for isc.org. <a name="IDN"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">IDN SUPPORT</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If <span Class="bold">dig</span> has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support, it can accept and display non-ASCII domain names. <span Class="bold">dig</span> appropriately converts character encoding of domain name before sending a request to DNS server or displaying a reply from the server. If you'd like to turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the <span Class="bold">IDN_DISABLE</span> environment variable.
