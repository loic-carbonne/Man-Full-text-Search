<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> is an <span Class="bold">sh</span>-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> also incorporates useful features from the <span Class="emphasis">Korn</span> and <span Class="emphasis">C</span> shells (<span Class="bold">ksh</span> and <span Class="bold">csh</span>). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). <span Class="bold">Bash</span> can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">All of the  single-character shell options documented in the description of the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command can be used as options when the shell is invoked. In addition, <span Class="bold">bash</span> interprets the following options when it is invoked: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-c</span> If the <span Class="bold">-c</span> option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument <span Class="emphasis">command_string .</span> If there are arguments after the <span Class="emphasis">command_string ,</span> they are assigned to the positional parameters, starting with <span Class="manpage">$0 .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-i</span> If the <span Class="bold">-i</span> option is present, the shell is <span Class="emphasis">interactive .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l</span> Make <span Class="bold">bash</span> act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-r</span> If the <span Class="bold">-r</span> option is present, the shell becomes <span Class="emphasis">restricted</span> (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#RESTRICTED">RESTRICTED SHELL</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s</span> If the <span Class="bold">-s</span> option is present, or if no arguments remain after option processing, then commands are read from the standard input. This option allows the positional parameters to be set when invoking an interactive shell. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-D</span> A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by <a class="bold" href="#">$</a> is printed on the standard output. These are the strings that are subject to language translation when the current locale is not <span Class="bold">C</span> or <span Class="bold">POSIX</span>. This implies the <span Class="bold">-n</span> option; no commands will be executed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">[-+]O [shopt_option]</span> <span Class="emphasis">shopt_option</span> is one of the shell options accepted by the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). If <span Class="emphasis">shopt_option</span> is present, <span Class="bold">-O</span> sets the value of that option; <span Class="bold">+O</span> unsets it. If <span Class="emphasis">shopt_option</span> is not supplied, the names and values of the shell options accepted by <span Class="bold">shopt</span> are printed on the standard output. If the invocation option is <span Class="bold">+O</span>, the output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--</span> A <span Class="bold">--</span> signals the end of options and disables further option processing. Any arguments after the <span Class="bold">--</span> are treated as filenames and arguments.  An argument of <span Class="bold">-</span> is equivalent to <span Class="bold">--</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> also interprets a number of multi-character options. These options must appear on the command line before the single-character options to be recognized. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--debugger</span> Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell starts. Turns on extended debugging mode (see the description of the <span Class="bold">extdebug</span> option to the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--dump-po-strings</span> Equivalent to <span Class="bold">-D</span>, but the output is in the GNU <span Class="emphasis">gettext</span> <span Class="bold">po</span> (portable object) file format. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--dump-strings</span> Equivalent to <span Class="bold">-D</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--help</span> Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--init-file</span> <span Class="emphasis">file</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--rcfile</span> <span Class="emphasis">file</span> 
<p class="level0">Execute commands from <span Class="emphasis">file</span> instead of the system wide initialization file <span Class="emphasis">/etc/bash.bashrc</span> and the standard personal initialization file <span Class="emphasis">~/.bashrc</span> if the shell is interactive (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--login</span> Equivalent to <span Class="bold">-l</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--noediting</span> Do not use the GNU <span Class="bold">readline</span> library to read command lines when the shell is interactive. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--noprofile</span> Do not read either the system-wide startup file 
<p class="level0">or any of the personal initialization files <span Class="emphasis">~/.bash_profile ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">~/.bash_login ,</span> or <span Class="emphasis">~/.profile .</span> By default, <span Class="bold">bash</span> reads these files when it is invoked as a login shell (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--norc</span> Do not read and execute the system wide initialization file <span Class="emphasis">/etc/bash.bashrc</span> and the personal initialization file <span Class="emphasis">~/.bashrc</span> if the shell is interactive. This option is on by default if the shell is invoked as <span Class="manpage">sh .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--posix</span> Change the behavior of <span Class="bold">bash</span> where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard (<span Class="emphasis">posix mode</span>). See 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SEE">SEE ALSO</a> below for a reference to a document that details how posix mode affects bash's behavior. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--restricted</span> The shell becomes restricted (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#RESTRICTED">RESTRICTED SHELL</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--verbose</span> Equivalent to  <span Class="bold">-v</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--version</span> Show version information for this instance of <span Class="bold">bash</span> on the standard output and exit successfully. 
<p class="level0"><a name="ARGUMENTS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ARGUMENTS</h2>
<p class="level0">If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the <span Class="bold">-c</span> nor the <span Class="bold">-s</span> option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands. If <span Class="bold">bash</span> is invoked in this fashion,  <span Class="bold">$0</span> is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. <span Class="bold">Bash</span>'s exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> for the script. <a name="INVOCATION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">INVOCATION</h2>
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">login shell</span> is one whose first character of argument zero is a <span Class="manpage">-</span>or one started with the  <span Class="bold">--login</span> option. 
<p class="level0">An <span Class="emphasis">interactive</span> shell is one started without non-option arguments and without the <span Class="bold">-c</span> option whose standard input and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by <span Class="emphasis">isatty (3)),</span> or one started with the <span Class="bold">-i</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS1</span> is set and <span Class="bold">$-</span> includes <span Class="bold">i</span> if <span Class="bold">bash</span> is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to test this state. 
<p class="level0">The following paragraphs describe how <span Class="bold">bash</span> executes its startup files. If any of the files exist but cannot be read, <span Class="bold">bash</span> reports an error. Tildes are expanded in filenames as described below under <a class="bold" href="#Tilde">Tilde Expansion</a> in the 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#EXPANSION">EXPANSION</a> section. 
<p class="level0">When <span Class="bold">bash</span> is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the <span Class="bold">--login</span> option, it first reads and executes commands from the file <span Class="emphasis">/etc/profile</span>, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for <span Class="emphasis">~/.bash_profile</span>, <span Class="emphasis">~/.bash_login</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">~/.profile</span>, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The <span Class="bold">--noprofile</span> option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior. 
<p class="level0">When a login shell exits, <span Class="bold">bash</span> reads and executes commands from the file <span Class="emphasis">~/.bash_logout</span>, if it exists. 
<p class="level0">When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, <span Class="bold">bash</span> reads and executes commands from <span Class="emphasis">/etc/bash.bashrc</span> and <span Class="emphasis">~/.bashrc</span>, if these files exist. This may be inhibited by using the <span Class="bold">--norc</span> option. The <span Class="bold">--rcfile</span> <span Class="emphasis">file</span> option will force <span Class="bold">bash</span> to read and execute commands from <span Class="emphasis">file</span> instead of <span Class="emphasis">/etc/bash.bashrc</span> and <span Class="emphasis">~/.bashrc</span>. 
<p class="level0">When <span Class="bold">bash</span> is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_ENV</span> in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> behaves as if the following command were executed: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">but the value of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> variable is not used to search for the filename. 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="bold">bash</span> is invoked with the name <span Class="manpage">sh</span>it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of <span Class="bold">sh</span> as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well. When invoked as an interactive login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the <span Class="bold">--login</span> option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from <span Class="emphasis">/etc/profile</span> and <span Class="emphasis">~/.profile ,</span> in that order. The <span Class="bold">--noprofile</span> option may be used to inhibit this behavior. When invoked as an interactive shell with the name <span Class="manpage">sh</span><span Class="bold">bash</span> looks for the variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">ENV</span>expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. Since a shell invoked as <span Class="bold">sh</span> does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup files, the <span Class="bold">--rcfile</span> option has no effect. A non-interactive shell invoked with the name <span Class="bold">sh</span> does not attempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked as <span Class="manpage">sh</span><span Class="bold">bash</span> enters <span Class="emphasis">posix</span> mode after the startup files are read. 
<p class="level0">When <span Class="bold">bash</span> is started in <span Class="emphasis">posix</span> mode, as with the <span Class="bold">--posix</span> command line option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files. In this mode, interactive shells expand the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ENV</span> variable and commands are read and executed from the file whose name is the expanded value. No other startup files are read. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input connected to a network connection, as when executed by the remote shell daemon, usually <span Class="emphasis">rshd</span>, or the secure shell daemon <span Class="emphasis">sshd</span>. If <span Class="bold">bash</span> determines it is being run in this fashion, it reads and executes commands from <span Class="emphasis">~/.bashrc</span> and <span Class="emphasis">~/.bashrc</span>, if these files exist and are readable. It will not do this if invoked as <span Class="bold">sh</span>. The <span Class="bold">--norc</span> option may be used to inhibit this behavior, and the <span Class="bold">--rcfile</span> option may be used to force another file to be read, but neither <span Class="emphasis">rshd</span> nor <span Class="emphasis">sshd</span> generally invoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified. 
<p class="level0">If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and the <span Class="bold">-p</span> option is not supplied, no startup files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment, the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SHELLOPTS</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">BASHOPTS</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">CDPATH</span>and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GLOBIGNORE</span> variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set to the real user id. If the <span Class="bold">-p</span> option is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset. <a name="DEFINITIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DEFINITIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">blank </span> A space or tab. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">word</span> A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell. Also known as a <span Class="manpage">token .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">name</span> A  <span Class="emphasis">word</span> consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.  Also referred to as an <span Class="manpage">identifier .</span>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="RESERVED"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">RESERVED WORDS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Reserved words</span> are words that have a special meaning to the shell. The following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and either the first word of a simple command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL GRAMMAR</a> below) or the third word of a  <span Class="bold">case </span> or <span Class="bold">for</span> command: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#"></a> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="SHELL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SHELL GRAMMAR</h2>
<p class="level0"><a name="Simple"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Simple Commands</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">simple command</span> is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by <span Class="bold">blank</span>-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a <span Class="emphasis">control operator</span>.  The first word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero. The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command. 
<p class="level0">The return value of a <span Class="emphasis">simple command</span> is its exit status, or 128+<span Class="emphasis">n^</span> if the command is terminated by signal <span Class="emphasis">n .</span> <a name="Pipelines"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Pipelines</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">pipeline</span> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators <a class="bold" href="#">|</a> or <a class="bold" href="#">|&</a>. The format for a pipeline is: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">[<span Class="bold">time</span> [<span Class="bold">-p</span>]] [ ! ] <span Class="emphasis">command</span> [ [<a class="bold" href="#">|</a>(bv<a class="bold" href="#">|&</a>] <span Class="emphasis">command2</span> ... ] 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The standard output of <span Class="emphasis">command</span> is connected via a pipe to the standard input of <span Class="emphasis">command2 .</span> This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#REDIRECTION">REDIRECTION</a> below). If <a class="bold" href="#">|&</a> is used, <span Class="emphasis">command</span>'s standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to <span Class="emphasis">command2</span>'s standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for <span Class="bold">2&gt;&1 |</span>. This implicit redirection of the standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by the command. 
<p class="level0">The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command, unless the <span Class="bold">pipefail</span> option is enabled. If <span Class="bold">pipefail</span> is enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully. If the reserved word <a class="bold" href="#">!</a> precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status as described above. The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value. 
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="bold">time</span> reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as user and system time consumed by its execution are reported when the pipeline terminates. The <span Class="bold">-p</span> option changes the output format to that specified by POSIX. When the shell is in <span Class="emphasis">posix mode</span>, it does not recognize <span Class="bold">time</span> as a reserved word if the next token begins with a `-'. The 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TIMEFORMAT</span> variable may be set to a format string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed; see the description of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TIMEFORMAT</span> under <a class="bold" href="#Shell">Shell Variables</a> below. 
<p class="level0">When the shell is in <span Class="emphasis">posix mode</span>, <span Class="bold">time</span> may be followed by a newline.  In this case, the shell displays the total user and system time consumed by the shell and its children. The 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TIMEFORMAT</span> variable may be used to specify the format of the time information. 
<p class="level0">Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a subshell). <a name="Lists"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Lists</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">list</span> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators <a class="manpage" href="#">;</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#">&</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#">&&</a>or <a class="manpage" href="#">||</a>and optionally terminated by one of <a class="manpage" href="#">;</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#">&</a>or <span Class="manpage">&lt;newline&gt; .</span>
<p class="level0">Of these list operators, <a class="bold" href="#">&&</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">||</a> have equal precedence, followed by <a class="bold" href="#">;</a> and <a class="manpage" href="#">&</a>which have equal precedence. 
<p class="level0">A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a <span Class="emphasis">list</span> instead of a semicolon to delimit commands. 
<p class="level0">If a command is terminated by the control operator <a class="manpage" href="#">&</a>the shell executes the command in the <span Class="emphasis">background</span> in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.  Commands separated by a <a class="bold" href="#">;</a> are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn.  The return status is the exit status of the last command executed. 
<p class="level0">AND and OR lists are sequences of one of more pipelines separated by the <a class="bold" href="#">&&</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">||</a> control operators, respectively. AND and OR lists are executed with left associativity. An AND list has the form 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">command1</span> <a class="bold" href="#">&&</a> <span Class="emphasis">command2</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">command2</span> is executed if, and only if, <span Class="emphasis">command1</span> returns an exit status of zero. 
<p class="level0">An OR list has the form 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">command1</span> <a class="bold" href="#">||</a> <span Class="emphasis">command2</span> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">command2</span> is executed if and only if <span Class="emphasis">command1</span> returns a non-zero exit status. The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list. <a name="Compound"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Compound Commands</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">compound command</span> is one of the following. In most cases a <span Class="emphasis">list</span> in a command's description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in place of a semicolon. 
<p class="level0">(<span Class="emphasis">list</span>) <span Class="emphasis">list</span> is executed in a subshell environment (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#COMMAND">COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</a> below). Variable assignments and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment do not remain in effect after the command completes.  The return status is the exit status of <span Class="emphasis">list</span>. 
<p class="level0">{ <span Class="emphasis">list</span>; } <span Class="emphasis">list</span> is simply executed in the current shell environment. <span Class="emphasis">list</span> must be terminated with a newline or semicolon. This is known as a <span Class="emphasis">group command</span>. The return status is the exit status of <span Class="emphasis">list</span>. Note that unlike the metacharacters <a class="bold" href="#">(</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">)</a>, <a class="bold" href="#">{</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">}</a> are <span Class="emphasis">reserved words</span> and must occur where a reserved word is permitted to be recognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they must be separated from <span Class="emphasis">list</span> by whitespace or another shell metacharacter. 
<p class="level0">((<span Class="emphasis">expression</span>)) The <span Class="emphasis">expression</span> is evaluated according to the rules described below under 
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#ARITHMETIC">ARITHMETIC EVALUATION .</a>If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the return status is 1.  This is exactly equivalent to <span class="bold">let "<span Class="emphasis">expression</span>"</span>. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">[[</a> <span Class="emphasis">expression</span> <a class="bold" href="#">]]</a> Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression <span Class="emphasis">expression</span>. Expressions are composed of the primaries described below under 
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#CONDITIONAL">CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS .</a>Word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the words between the <a class="bold" href="#">[[</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">]]</a>; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process substitution, and quote removal are performed. Conditional operators such as <span Class="bold">-f</span> must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When used with <a class="bold" href="#">[[</a>, the <span Class="bold">&lt;</span> and <span Class="bold">&gt;</span> operators sort lexicographically using the current locale. 
<p class="level0">See the description of the <span Class="emphasis">test</span> builtin command (section SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) for the handling of parameters (i.e. missing parameters). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When the <a class="bold" href="#">==</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">!=</a> operators are used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the rules described below under <span Class="bold">Pattern Matching</span>, as if the <span Class="bold">extglob</span> shell option were enabled. The <a class="bold" href="#">=</a> operator is equivalent to <a class="bold" href="#">==</a>. If the shell option <span Class="bold">nocasematch</span> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. The return value is 0 if the string matches (<a class="bold" href="#">==</a>) or does not match (<a class="bold" href="#">!=</a>) the pattern, and 1 otherwise. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched as a string. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">An additional binary operator, <a class="bold" href="#">=~</a>, is available, with the same precedence as <a class="bold" href="#">==</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">!=</a>. When it is used, the string to the right of the operator is considered an extended regular expression and matched accordingly (as in <span Class="emphasis">regex</span>(3)).   The return value is 0 if the string matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise. If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the conditional expression's return value is 2. If the shell option <span Class="bold">nocasematch</span> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched as a string. Bracket expressions in regular expressions must be treated carefully, since normal quoting characters lose their meanings between brackets. If the pattern is stored in a shell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire pattern to be matched as a string. Substrings matched by parenthesized subexpressions within the regular expression are saved in the array variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">BASH_REMATCH .</span>The element of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_REMATCH</span> with index 0 is the portion of the string matching the entire regular expression. The element of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_REMATCH</span> with index <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is the portion of the string matching the <span Class="emphasis">n</span>th parenthesized subexpression.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">coprocess</span> is a shell command preceded by the <span Class="bold">coproc</span> reserved word. A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command had been terminated with the <a class="bold" href="#">&</a> control operator, with a two-way pipe established between the executing shell and the coprocess. 
<p class="level0">The format for a coprocess is: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">coproc</span> [<a class="emphasis" href="#NAME">NAME</a>] <span Class="emphasis">command</span> [<span Class="emphasis">redirections</span>] 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This creates a coprocess named <a class="emphasis" href="#NAME">NAME</a>. If <a class="emphasis" href="#NAME">NAME</a> is not supplied, the default name is <span Class="bold">COPROC</span>. <a class="emphasis" href="#NAME">NAME</a> must not be supplied if <span Class="emphasis">command</span> is a <span class="emphasis">simple command</span> (see above); otherwise, it is interpreted as the first word of the simple command. When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array variable (see <a class="bold" href="#Arrays">Arrays</a> below) named <a class="emphasis" href="#NAME">NAME</a> in the context of the executing shell. The standard output of <span Class="emphasis">command</span> is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to <a class="emphasis" href="#NAME">NAME</a>[0]. The standard input of <span Class="emphasis">command</span> is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to <a class="emphasis" href="#NAME">NAME</a>[1]. This pipe is established before any redirections specified by the command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#REDIRECTION">REDIRECTION</a> below). The file descriptors can be utilized as arguments to shell commands and redirections using standard word expansions. The file descriptors are not available in subshells. The process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is available as the value of the variable <a class="emphasis" href="#NAME">NAME</a>_PID. The <span Class="bold">wait</span> builtin command may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate. 
<p class="level0">Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the <span Class="bold">coproc</span> command always returns success. The return status of a coprocess is the exit status of <span Class="emphasis">command</span>. <a name="Shell"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Shell Function Definitions</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command and executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters. Shell functions are declared as follows: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">name</span> () <span Class="emphasis">compound-command</span> [<span Class="emphasis">redirection</span>] 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">function</span> <span Class="emphasis">name</span> [()] <span Class="emphasis">compound-command</span> [<span Class="emphasis">redirection</span>] 
<p class="level0">This defines a function named <span Class="emphasis">name</span>. The reserved word <span Class="bold">function</span> is optional. If the <span Class="bold">function</span> reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional. The <span Class="emphasis">body</span> of the function is the compound command <span Class="emphasis">compound-command </span> (see <a class="bold" href="#Compound">Compound Commands</a> above). That command is usually a <span Class="emphasis">list</span> of commands between { and }, but may be any command listed under <a class="bold" href="#Compound">Compound Commands</a> above. <span Class="emphasis">compound-command</span> is executed whenever <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is specified as the name of a simple command. When in <span Class="emphasis">posix mode</span>, <span Class="emphasis">name</span> may not be the name of one of the POSIX <span Class="emphasis">special builtins</span>. Any redirections (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#REDIRECTION">REDIRECTION</a> below) specified when a function is defined are performed when the function is executed. The exit status of a function definition is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly function with the same name already exists. When executed, the exit status of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the body.  (See 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a> below.) <a name="COMMENTS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMMENTS</h2>
<p class="level0">In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the <span Class="bold">interactive_comments</span> option to the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin is enabled (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below), a word beginning with <a class="bold" href="#">#</a> causes that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.  An interactive shell without the <span Class="bold">interactive_comments</span> option enabled does not allow comments.  The <span Class="bold">interactive_comments</span> option is on by default in interactive shells. <a name="QUOTING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">QUOTING</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Quoting</span> is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to  disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion. 
<p class="level0">Each of the <span Class="emphasis">metacharacters</span> listed above under 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#DEFINITIONS">DEFINITIONS</a> has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself. 
<p class="level0">When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY EXPANSION</a> below), the <span Class="emphasis">history expansion</span> character, usually <a class="bold" href="#">!</a>, must be quoted to prevent history expansion. 
<p class="level0">There are three quoting mechanisms: the <span Class="emphasis">escape character ,</span> single quotes, and double quotes. 
<p class="level0">A non-quoted backslash (<span Class="bold">e</span>) is the <span Class="emphasis">escape character .</span> It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of &lt;newline&gt;.  If a <span Class="bold">e</span>&lt;newline&gt; pair appears, and the backslash is not itself quoted, the <span Class="bold">e</span>&lt;newline&gt; is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored). 
<p class="level0">Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash. 
<p class="level0">Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of <a class="manpage" href="#">$</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#">\`</a>, <span Class="manpage">\e</span>and, when history expansion is enabled, <a class="manpage" href="#">! .</a>The characters <a class="bold" href="#">$</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">\`</a> retain their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: <a class="manpage" href="#">$</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#">\`</a>^<a class="bold" href="#">"</a>^, <span Class="manpage">\e</span>or <span Class="manpage">&lt;newline&gt; .</span>A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an <a class="bold" href="#">!</a> appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the <a class="bold" href="#">!</a> is not removed. 
<p class="level0">The special parameters <a class="bold" href="#">*</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">@</a> have special meaning when in double quotes (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a> below). 
<p class="level0">Words of the form <a class="bold" href="#">$</a>(aq<span Class="emphasis">string</span>(aq are treated specially.  The word expands to <span Class="emphasis">string</span>, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard.  Backslash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ea</span> alert (bell) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\eb</span> backspace

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\e\e</span> backslash 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\e\(aq</span> single quote 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\e\(dq</span> double quote 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ennn</span> the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <span Class="emphasis">nnn</span> (one to three digits) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\exHH</span> the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <span Class="emphasis">HH</span> (one or two hex digits) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\euHHHH</span> the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value <span Class="emphasis">HHHH</span> (one to four hex digits) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\eUHHHHHHHH</span> the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value <span Class="emphasis">HHHHHHHH</span> (one to eight hex digits) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ecx</span> a control-<span Class="emphasis">x</span> character 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had not been present. 
<p class="level0">A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign (<a class="bold" href="#">$</a>(dq<span Class="emphasis">string</span>(dq) will cause the string to be translated according to the current locale. If the current locale is <span Class="bold">C</span> or <span Class="bold">POSIX</span>, the dollar sign is ignored. If the string is translated and replaced, the replacement is double-quoted. <a name="PARAMETERS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PARAMETERS</h2>
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> is an entity that stores values. It can be a <span Class="emphasis">name ,</span> a number, or one of the special characters listed below under <a class="manpage" href="#Special">Special Parameters .</a>A <span Class="emphasis">variable</span> is a parameter denoted by a <span Class="emphasis">name .</span> A variable has a <span Class="emphasis">value</span> and zero or more <span Class="emphasis">attributes</span>. Attributes are assigned using the <span Class="bold">declare</span> builtin command (see <span Class="bold">declare</span> below in 
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS ).</a>
<p class="level0">A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the <span Class="bold">unset</span> builtin command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). 
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">variable</span> may be assigned to by a statement of the form 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">name</span>=[<span Class="emphasis">value</span>] 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">value</span> is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All <span Class="emphasis">values</span> undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#EXPANSION">EXPANSION</a> below).  If the variable has its <span Class="bold">integer</span> attribute set, then <span Class="emphasis">value</span> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see <a class="bold" href="#Arithmetic">Arithmetic Expansion</a> below). Word splitting is not performed, with the exception of <a class="bold" href="#">"$@"</a> as explained below under <a class="manpage" href="#Special">Special Parameters .</a>Pathname expansion is not performed. Assignment statements may also appear as arguments to the <span Class="manpage">alias</span>, <span Class="manpage">declare</span>, <span Class="manpage">typeset</span>, <span Class="manpage">export</span>, <span Class="manpage">readonly</span>and <span Class="bold">local</span> builtin commands. When in <span Class="emphasis">posix mode</span>, these builtins may appear in a command after one or more instances of the <span Class="bold">command</span> builtin and retain these assignment statement properties. 
<p class="level0">In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to or add to the variable's previous value. When += is applied to a variable for which the <span Class="emphasis">integer</span> attribute has been set, <span Class="emphasis">value</span> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable's current value, which is also evaluated. When += is applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see <a class="bold" href="#Arrays">Arrays</a> below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using =), and new values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays) or added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array. When applied to a string-valued variable, <span Class="emphasis">value</span> is expanded and appended to the variable's value. 
<p class="level0">A variable can be assigned the <span Class="emphasis">nameref</span> attribute using the <span Class="bold">-n</span> option to the <span Class="bold">declare</span> or <span Class="bold">local</span> builtin commands (see the descriptions of <span Class="bold">declare</span> and <span Class="bold">local</span> below) to create a <span Class="emphasis">nameref</span>, or a reference to another variable. This allows variables to be manipulated indirectly. Whenever the nameref variable is referenced or assigned to, the operation is actually performed on the variable specified by the nameref variable's value. A nameref is commonly used within shell functions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an argument to the function. For instance, if a variable name is passed to a shell function as its first argument, running 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">inside the function creates a nameref variable <span Class="bold">ref</span> whose value is the variable name passed as the first argument. References and assignments to <span Class="bold">ref</span> are treated as references and assignments to the variable whose name was passed as <a class="bold" href="#1">$1</a>. If the control variable in a <span Class="bold">for</span> loop has the nameref attribute, the list of words can be a list of shell variables, and a name reference will be established for each word in the list, in turn, when the loop is executed. Array variables cannot be given the <span Class="bold">-n</span> attribute. However, nameref variables can reference array variables and subscripted array variables. Namerefs can be unset using the <span Class="bold">-n</span> option to the <span Class="bold">unset</span> builtin. Otherwise, if <span Class="bold">unset</span> is executed with the name of a nameref variable as an argument, the variable referenced by the nameref variable will be unset. <a name="Positional"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Positional Parameters</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A <span Class="emphasis">positional parameter</span> is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to with assignment statements.  The positional parameters are temporarily replaced when a shell function is executed (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a> below). 
<p class="level0">When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#EXPANSION">EXPANSION</a> below). <a name="Special"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Special Parameters</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">*</a> Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion is not within double quotes, each positional parameter expands to a separate word. In contexts where it is performed, those words are subject to further word splitting and pathname expansion. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the  
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> special variable.  That is, "<a class="bold" href="#">$*</a>" is equivalent to "<a class="bold" href="#1">$1</a><span Class="emphasis">c</span><a class="bold" href="#2">$2</a><span Class="emphasis">c</span><a class="bold" href="#">...</a>", where <span Class="emphasis">c</span> is the first character of the value of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> variable.  If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">@</a> Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.  That is, "<a class="bold" href="#">$@</a>" is equivalent to "<a class="bold" href="#1">$1</a>" "<a class="bold" href="#2">$2</a>" ... If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. When there are no positional parameters, "<a class="bold" href="#">$@</a>" and  <a class="bold" href="#">$@</a> expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed). 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">#</a> Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">?</a> Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.

<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">!</a> Expands to the process ID of the job most recently placed into the background, whether executed as an asynchronous command or using the <span Class="bold">bg</span> builtin (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#JOB">JOB CONTROL</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">0</span> Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is set at shell initialization.  If <span Class="bold">bash</span> is invoked with a file of commands, <span Class="bold">$0</span> is set to the name of that file.  If <span Class="bold">bash</span> is started with the <span Class="bold">-c</span> option, then <span Class="bold">$0</span> is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it is set to the filename used to invoke <span Class="manpage">bash</span>as given by argument zero. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">_</a> At shell startup, set to the absolute pathname used to invoke the shell or shell script being executed as passed in the environment or argument list. Subsequently, expands to the last argument to the previous command, after expansion.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This variable can be used with <span Class="bold">BASH_LINENO</span> and <span Class="bold">BASH_SOURCE</span>. Each element of <span Class="bold">FUNCNAME</span> has corresponding elements in <span Class="bold">BASH_LINENO</span> and <span Class="bold">BASH_SOURCE</span> to describe the call stack. For instance, <span Class="bold">${FUNCNAME[</span><span Class="emphasis">$i</span><a class="bold" href="#">]}</a> was called from the file <span Class="bold">${BASH_SOURCE[</span><span Class="emphasis">$i+1</span><a class="bold" href="#">]}</a> at line number <span Class="bold">${BASH_LINENO[</span><span Class="emphasis">$i</span><a class="bold" href="#">]}</a>. The <span Class="bold">caller</span> builtin displays the current call stack using this information. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GROUPS</span> An array variable containing the list of groups of which the current user is a member. Assignments to     
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GROUPS</span> have no effect and return an error status. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GROUPS</span> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTCMD</span> The history number, or index in the history list, of the current command. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTCMD</span> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOSTNAME</span> Automatically set to the name of the current host. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOSTTYPE</span> Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes the type of machine on which <span Class="bold">bash</span> is executing. The default is system-dependent. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LINENO</span> Each time this parameter is referenced, the shell substitutes a decimal number representing the current sequential line number (starting with 1) within a script or function.  When not in a script or function, the value substituted is not guaranteed to be meaningful. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LINENO</span> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">MACHTYPE</span> Automatically set to a string that fully describes the system type on which <span Class="bold">bash</span> is executing, in the standard GNU <span Class="emphasis">cpu-company-system</span> format. The default is system-dependent. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">MAPFILE</span> An array variable (see <a class="bold" href="#Arrays">Arrays</a> below) created to hold the text read by the <span Class="bold">mapfile</span> builtin when no variable name is supplied.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTARG</span> The value of the last option argument processed by the <span Class="bold">getopts</span> builtin command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTIND</span> The index of the next argument to be processed by the <span Class="bold">getopts</span> builtin command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OSTYPE</span> Automatically set to a string that describes the operating system on which <span Class="bold">bash</span> is executing. The default is system-dependent. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PIPESTATUS</span> An array variable (see <a class="bold" href="#Arrays">Arrays</a> below) containing a list of exit status values from the processes in the most-recently-executed foreground pipeline (which may contain only a single command). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PPID</span> The process ID of the shell's parent.  This variable is readonly. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PWD</span> The current working directory as set by the <span Class="bold">cd</span> command. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">RANDOM</span> Each time this parameter is referenced, a random integer between 0 and 32767 is generated.  The sequence of random numbers may be initialized by assigning a value to 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">RANDOM .</span>If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">RANDOM</span> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">READLINE_LINE</span> The contents of the <span Class="bold">readline</span> line buffer, for use with 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">(see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">READLINE_POINT</span> The position of the insertion point in the <span Class="bold">readline</span> line buffer, for use with 
<p class="level0">

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">REPLY</span> Set to the line of input read by the <span Class="bold">read</span> builtin command when no arguments are supplied. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SECONDS</span> Each time this parameter is referenced, the number of seconds since shell invocation is returned.  If a value is assigned to  
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SECONDS</span>the value returned upon subsequent references is the number of seconds since the assignment plus the value assigned. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SECONDS</span> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SHELLOPTS</span> A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in the list is a valid argument for the <span Class="bold">-o</span> option to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below).  The options appearing in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SHELLOPTS</span> are those reported as <span Class="emphasis">on</span> by <span Class="bold">set -o</span>. If this variable is in the environment when <span Class="bold">bash</span> starts up, each shell option in the list will be enabled before reading any startup files. This variable is read-only. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SHLVL</span> Incremented by one each time an instance of <span Class="bold">bash</span> is started. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">UID</span> Expands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup. This variable is readonly. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The following variables are used by the shell.  In some cases, <span Class="bold">bash</span> assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted below. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_COMPAT</span> The value is used to set the shell's compatibility level. See the description of the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin below under <a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> for a description of the various compatibility levels and their effects. The value may be a decimal number (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding to the desired compatibility level. If <span Class="bold">BASH_COMPAT</span> is unset or set to the empty string, the compatibility level is set to the default for the current version. If <span Class="bold">BASH_COMPAT</span> is set to a value that is not one of the valid compatibility levels, the shell prints an error message and sets the compatibility level to the default for the current version. The valid compatibility levels correspond to the compatibility options accepted by the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin described below (for example, <span Class="bold">compat42</span> means that 4.2 and 42 are valid values). The current version is also a valid value. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_ENV</span> If this parameter is set when <span Class="bold">bash</span> is executing a shell script, its value is interpreted as a filename containing commands to initialize the shell, as in <span Class="emphasis">~/.bashrc .</span> The value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_ENV</span> is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a filename. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> is not used to search for the resultant filename. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_XTRACEFD</span> If set to an integer corresponding to a valid file descriptor, <span Class="bold">bash</span> will write the trace output generated when 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">is enabled to that file descriptor. The file descriptor is closed when 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_XTRACEFD</span> is unset or assigned a new value. Unsetting 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_XTRACEFD</span> or assigning it the empty string causes the trace output to be sent to the standard error. Note that setting 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BASH_XTRACEFD</span> to 2 (the standard error file descriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the standard error being closed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> The search path for the <span Class="bold">cd</span> command. This is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for destination directories specified by the <span Class="bold">cd</span> command. A sample value is 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CHILD_MAX</span> Set the number of exited child status values for the shell to remember. Bash will not allow this value to be decreased below a POSIX-mandated minimum, and there is a maximum value (currently 8192) that this may not exceed. The minimum value is system-dependent. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">COLUMNS</span> Used by the <span Class="bold">select</span> compound command to determine the terminal width when printing selection lists. Automatically set if the <span Class="bold">checkwinsize</span> option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon receipt of a 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGWINCH .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">COMPREPLY</span> An array variable from which <span Class="bold">bash</span> reads the possible completions generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable completion facility (see <a class="bold" href="#Programmable">Programmable Completion</a> below). Each array element contains one possible completion. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">EMACS</span> If <span Class="bold">bash</span> finds this variable in the environment when the shell starts with value 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">it assumes that the shell is running in an Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ENV</span> Similar to 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">BASH_ENV ;</span>used when the shell is invoked in POSIX mode. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FCEDIT</span> The default editor for the <span Class="bold">fc</span> builtin command. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FIGNORE</span> A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#READLINE">READLINE</a> below). A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in  
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FIGNORE</span> is excluded from the list of matched filenames. A sample value is 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">(Quoting is needed when assigning a value to this variable, which contains tildes). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FUNCNEST</span> If set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed this nesting level will cause the current command to abort. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GLOBIGNORE</span> A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames to be ignored by pathname expansion. If a filename matched by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the patterns in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">GLOBIGNORE</span>it is removed from the list of matches. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTCONTROL</span> A colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list. If the list of values includes <span Class="emphasis">ignorespace ,</span> lines which begin with a <span Class="bold">space</span> character are not saved in the history list. A value of  <span Class="emphasis">ignoredups</span> causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be saved. A value of <span Class="emphasis">ignoreboth</span> is shorthand for <span Class="emphasis">ignorespace</span> and <span Class="emphasis">ignoredups</span>. A value of <span Class="emphasis">erasedups</span> causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved. Any value not in the above list is ignored. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTCONTROL</span> is unset, or does not include a valid value, all lines read by the shell parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">HISTIGNORE .</span>The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">HISTCONTROL .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTFILE</span> The name of the file in which command history is saved (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a> below).  The default value is <span Class="emphasis">~/.bash_history</span>.  If unset, the command history is not saved when a shell exits. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTFILESIZE</span> The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than that number of lines by removing the oldest entries. The history file is also truncated to this size after writing it when a shell exits. If the value is 0, the history file is truncated to zero size. Non-numeric values and numeric values less than zero inhibit truncation. The shell sets the default value to the value of <span Class="bold">HISTSIZE</span> after reading any startup files. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTIGNORE</span> A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command lines should be saved on the history list.  Each pattern is anchored at the beginning of the line and must match the complete line (no implicit `<a class="bold" href="#">*</a>' is appended).  Each pattern is tested against the line after the checks specified by 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTCONTROL</span> are applied. In addition to the normal shell pattern matching characters, `<a class="bold" href="#">&</a>' matches the previous history line.  `<a class="bold" href="#">&</a>' may be escaped using a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match. The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">HISTIGNORE .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTSIZE</span> The number of commands to remember in the command history (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a> below). If the value is 0, commands are not saved in the history list. Numeric values less than zero result in every command being saved on the history list (there is no limit). The shell sets the default value to 500 after reading any startup files. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTTIMEFORMAT</span> If this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a format string for <span Class="emphasis">strftime</span>(3) to print the time stamp associated with each history entry displayed by the <span Class="bold">history</span> builtin. If this variable is set, time stamps are written to the history file so they may be preserved across shell sessions. This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOME</span> The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the <span Class="bold">cd</span> builtin command. The value of this variable is also used when performing tilde expansion. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOSTFILE</span> Contains the name of a file in the same format as 
<p class="level0">that should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname. The list of possible hostname completions may be changed while the shell is running; the next time hostname completion is attempted after the value is changed, <span Class="bold">bash</span> adds the contents of the new file to the existing list. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOSTFILE</span> is set, but has no value, or does not name a readable file, <span Class="bold">bash</span> attempts to read 
<p class="level0">to obtain the list of possible hostname completions. When 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOSTFILE</span> is unset, the hostname list is cleared. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> The <span Class="emphasis">Internal Field Separator</span> that is used for word splitting after expansion and to split lines into words with the <span Class="bold">read</span> builtin command.  The default value is ``&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;''. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IGNOREEOF</span> Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">EOF</span> character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number of consecutive 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">EOF</span> characters which must be typed as the first characters on an input line before <span Class="bold">bash</span> exits.  If the variable exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no value, the default value is 10.  If it does not exist, 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">EOF</span> signifies the end of input to the shell. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">INPUTRC</span> The filename for the <span Class="bold">readline</span> startup file, overriding the default of 
<p class="level0">(see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#READLINE">READLINE</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LANG</span> Used to determine the locale category for any category not specifically selected with a variable starting with <span Class="bold">LC_</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LC_ALL</span> This variable overrides the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LANG</span> and any other <span Class="bold">LC_</span> variable specifying a locale category. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LC_COLLATE</span> This variable determines the collation order used when sorting the results of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior of range expressions, equivalence classes, and collating sequences within pathname expansion and pattern matching. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LC_CTYPE</span> This variable determines the interpretation of characters and the behavior of character classes within pathname expansion and pattern matching. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LC_MESSAGES</span> This variable determines the locale used to translate double-quoted strings preceded by a <a class="bold" href="#">$</a>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LC_NUMERIC</span> This variable determines the locale category used for number formatting. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">LINES</span> Used by the <span Class="bold">select</span> compound command to determine the column length for printing selection lists. Automatically set if the <span Class="bold">checkwinsize</span> option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon receipt of a 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGWINCH .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">MAIL</span> If this parameter is set to a file or directory name and the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">MAILPATH</span> variable is not set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> informs the user of the arrival of mail in the specified file or Maildir-format directory. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">MAILCHECK</span> Specifies how often (in seconds) <span Class="bold">bash</span> checks for mail.  The default is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail, the shell does so before displaying the primary prompt. If this variable is unset, or set to a value that is not a number greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">MAILPATH</span> A colon-separated list of filenames to be checked for mail.  The message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file may be specified by separating the filename from the message with a `?'. When used in the text of the message, <a class="bold" href="#">$_</a> expands to the name of the current mailfile.  Example: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">MAILPATH</span>=(aq/var/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"(aq 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> supplies a default value for this variable, but the location of the user mail files that it uses is system dependent (e.g., /var/mail/<span Class="bold">$USER</span>). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTERR</span> If set to the value 1, <span Class="bold">bash</span> displays error messages generated by the <span Class="bold">getopts</span> builtin command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTERR</span> is initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a shell script is executed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> The search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#COMMAND">COMMAND EXECUTION</a> below). A zero-length (null) directory name in the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> indicates the current directory. A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon. The default path is system-dependent, and is set by the administrator who installs <span Class="manpage">bash .</span>A common value is 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">POSIXLY_CORRECT</span> If this variable is in the environment when <span Class="bold">bash</span> starts, the shell enters <span Class="emphasis">posix mode</span> before reading the startup files, as if the <span Class="bold">--posix</span> invocation option had been supplied.  If it is set while the shell is running, <span Class="bold">bash</span> enables <span Class="emphasis">posix mode</span>, as if the command 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">had been executed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PROMPT_COMMAND</span> If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PROMPT_DIRTRIM</span> If set to a number greater than zero, the value is used as the number of trailing directory components to retain when expanding the <span Class="bold">ew</span> and <span Class="bold">eW</span> prompt string escapes (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#PROMPTING">PROMPTING</a> below).  Characters removed are replaced with an ellipsis. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS1</span> The value of this parameter is expanded (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#PROMPTING">PROMPTING</a> below) and used as the primary prompt string.  The default value is ``<span Class="bold">es-eve$ </span>''. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS2</span> The value of this parameter is expanded as with 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS1</span> and used as the secondary prompt string.  The default is ``<span Class="bold">&gt; </span>''. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS3</span> The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the <span Class="bold">select</span> command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL GRAMMAR</a> above). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS4</span> The value of this parameter is expanded as with 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS1</span> and the value is printed before each command <span Class="bold">bash</span> displays during an execution trace.  The first character of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS4</span> is replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of indirection.  The default is ``<a class="bold" href="#">+ </a>''. 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL</a> The full pathname to the shell is kept in this environment variable. If it is not set when the shell starts, <span Class="bold">bash</span> assigns to it the full pathname of the current user's login shell. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TIMEFORMAT</span> The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the <span Class="bold">time</span> reserved word should be displayed. The <a class="bold" href="#">%</a> character introduces an escape sequence that is expanded to a time value or other information. The escape sequences and their meanings are as follows; the braces denote optional portions. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">%%</a> A literal <a class="bold" href="#">%</a>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">%[p][l]R</span> The elapsed time in seconds. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">%[p][l]U</span> The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">%[p][l]S</span> The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">%P</span> The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The optional <span Class="emphasis">p</span> is a digit specifying the <span Class="emphasis">precision</span>, the number of fractional digits after a decimal point. A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output. At most three places after the decimal point may be specified; values of <span Class="emphasis">p</span> greater than 3 are changed to 3. If <span Class="emphasis">p</span> is not specified, the value 3 is used. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The optional <span Class="bold">l</span> specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the form <span Class="emphasis">MM</span>m<span Class="emphasis">SS</span>.<span Class="emphasis">FF</span>s. The value of <span Class="emphasis">p</span> determines whether or not the fraction is included. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If this variable is not set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> acts as if it had the value <span Class="bold">$(aqenrealet%3lRenuseret%3lUensyset%3lS(aq</span>. If the value is null, no timing information is displayed. A trailing newline is added when the format string is displayed. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">TMOUT</span> If set to a value greater than zero, 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">TMOUT</span> is treated as the default timeout for the <span Class="bold">read</span> builtin. The <span Class="bold">select</span> command terminates if input does not arrive after 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">TMOUT</span> seconds when input is coming from a terminal. In an interactive shell, the value is interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for a line of input after issuing the primary prompt. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> terminates after waiting for that number of seconds if a complete line of input does not arrive. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">TMPDIR</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> uses its value as the name of a directory in which <span Class="bold">bash</span> creates temporary files for the shell's use. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">auto_resume</span> This variable controls how the shell interacts with the user and job control.  If this variable is set, single word simple commands without redirections are treated as candidates for resumption of an existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is more than one job beginning with the string typed, the job most recently accessed is selected.  The <span Class="emphasis">name</span> of a stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to start it. If set to the value <span Class="emphasis">exact ,</span> the string supplied must match the name of a stopped job exactly; if set to <span Class="emphasis">substring ,</span> the string supplied needs to match a substring of the name of a stopped job.  The <span Class="emphasis">substring</span> value provides functionality analogous to the <a class="bold" href="#">%?</a> job identifier (see 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#JOB">JOB CONTROL</a> below).  If set to any other value, the supplied string must be a prefix of a stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to the <a class="bold" href="#">%</a><span Class="emphasis">string</span> job identifier. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">histchars</span> The two or three characters which control history expansion and tokenization (see 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY EXPANSION</a> below).  The first character is the <span Class="emphasis">history expansion</span> character, the character which signals the start of a history expansion, normally `<a class="bold" href="#">!</a>'. The second character is the <span Class="emphasis">quick substitution</span> character, which is used as shorthand for re-running the previous command entered, substituting one string for another in the command. The default is `<a class="bold" href="#">^</a>'. The optional third character is the character which indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment when found as the first character of a word, normally `<span Class="bold">&#35;</span>'.  The history comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the remaining words on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment. 
<p class="level1"><a name="Arrays"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Arrays</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array variables. Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the <span Class="bold">declare</span> builtin will explicitly declare an array. There is no maximum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously. Indexed arrays are referenced using integers (including arithmetic expressions)  and are zero-based; associative arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings. Unless otherwise noted, indexed array indices must be non-negative integers. 
<p class="level0">An indexed array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax <span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>]=<span Class="emphasis">value</span>.  The <span Class="emphasis">subscript</span> is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number. To explicitly declare an indexed array, use <span Class="bold">declare -a name</span> (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). <span Class="bold">declare -a name[subscript]</span> is also accepted; the <span Class="emphasis">subscript</span> is ignored. 
<p class="level0">Associative arrays are created using <span Class="manpage">declare -A \fIname\fP .</span>
<p class="level0">Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the <span Class="bold">declare</span> and <span Class="bold">readonly</span> builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array. 
<p class="level0">Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form <span Class="emphasis">name</span>=<a class="bold" href="#">(</a>value<a class="emphasis" href="#1">1</a> ... value<span Class="emphasis">n</span><a class="bold" href="#">)</a>, where each <span Class="emphasis">value</span> is of the form [<span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>]=<span Class="emphasis">string</span>. Indexed array assignments do not require anything but <span Class="emphasis">string</span>. When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last index assigned to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero. 
<p class="level0">When assigning to an associative array, the subscript is required. 
<p class="level0">This syntax is also accepted by the <span Class="bold">declare</span> builtin.  Individual array elements may be assigned to using the <span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>]=<span Class="emphasis">value</span> syntax introduced above. When assigning to an indexed array, if <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of <span Class="emphasis">name</span>, so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element. 
<p class="level0">Any element of an array may be referenced using ${<span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>]}.  The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If <span Class="emphasis">subscript</span> is <a class="bold" href="#">@</a> or <a class="bold" href="#">*</a>, the word expands to all members of <span Class="emphasis">name</span>.  These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes.  If the word is double-quoted, ${<span Class="emphasis">name</span>[*]} expands to a single word with the value of each array member separated by the first character of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> special variable, and ${<span Class="emphasis">name</span>[@]} expands each element of <span Class="emphasis">name</span> to a separate word.  When there are no array members, ${<span Class="emphasis">name</span>[@]} expands to nothing. If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. This is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters <a class="bold" href="#">*</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">@</a> (see <a class="bold" href="#Special">Special Parameters</a> above).  ${&#35;<span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>]} expands to the length of ${<span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>]}.  If <span Class="emphasis">subscript</span> is <a class="bold" href="#">*</a> or <a class="bold" href="#">@</a>, the expansion is the number of elements in the array. Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with a subscript of 0. If the <span Class="emphasis">subscript</span> used to reference an element of an indexed array evaluates to a number less than zero, it is  interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of the array, so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last element. 
<p class="level0">An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value. 
<p class="level0">It is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the values. ${<a class="bold" href="#">!</a><span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<a class="emphasis" href="#">@</a>]} and ${<a class="bold" href="#">!</a><span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<a class="emphasis" href="#">*</a>]} expand to the indices assigned in array variable <span Class="emphasis">name</span>. The treatment when in double quotes is similar to the expansion of the special parameters <a class="emphasis" href="#">@</a> and <a class="emphasis" href="#">*</a> within double quotes. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">unset</span> builtin is used to destroy arrays.  <span Class="bold">unset</span> <span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>] destroys the array element at index <span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>. Negative subscripts to indexed arrays are interpreted as described above. Care must be taken to avoid unwanted side effects caused by pathname expansion. <span Class="bold">unset</span> <span Class="emphasis">name</span>, where <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is an array, or <span Class="bold">unset</span> <span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<span Class="emphasis">subscript</span>], where <span Class="emphasis">subscript</span> is <a class="bold" href="#">*</a> or <a class="bold" href="#">@</a>, removes the entire array. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="manpage">declare</span>, <span Class="manpage">local</span>and <span Class="bold">readonly</span> builtins each accept a <span Class="bold">-a</span> option to specify an indexed array and a <span Class="bold">-A</span> option to specify an associative array. If both options are supplied,  <span Class="bold">-A</span> takes precedence. The <span Class="bold">read</span> builtin accepts a <span Class="bold">-a</span> option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an array.  The <span Class="bold">set</span> and <span Class="bold">declare</span> builtins display array values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments. <a name="EXPANSION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EXPANSION</h2>
<p class="level0">Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into words.  There are seven kinds of expansion performed: <span Class="emphasis">brace expansion ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">tilde expansion ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">parameter and variable expansion ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">command substitution ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">arithmetic expansion ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">word splitting ,</span> and <span Class="emphasis">pathname expansion .</span> 
<p class="level0">The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname expansion. 
<p class="level0">On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: <span Class="emphasis">process substitution</span>. This is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and command substitution. 
<p class="level0">Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can change the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word. The only exceptions to this are the expansions of "<a class="bold" href="#">$@</a>" and "<a class="bold" href="#">${</a><span Class="emphasis">name</span><a class="bold" href="#">[@]}</a>" as explained above (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS ).</a><a name="Brace"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Brace Expansion</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a class="emphasis" href="#Brace">Brace expansion</a> is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This mechanism is similar to <span Class="emphasis">pathname expansion</span>, but the filenames generated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional <span Class="emphasis">preamble ,</span> followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, followed by an optional <span Class="emphasis">postscript .</span> The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right. 
<p class="level0">Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For example, a<a class="bold" href="#">{</a>d,c,b<a class="bold" href="#">}</a>e expands into `ade ace abe'. 
<p class="level0">A sequence expression takes the form <a class="bold" href="#">{</a><span Class="emphasis">x</span><a class="bold" href="#">..</a><span Class="emphasis">y</span><a class="bold" href="#">[..</a><span Class="emphasis">incr</span><a class="bold" href="#">]}</a>, where <span Class="emphasis">x</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span> are either integers or single characters, and <span Class="emphasis">incr</span>, an optional increment, is an integer. When integers are supplied, the expression expands to each number between <span Class="emphasis">x</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span>, inclusive. Supplied integers may be prefixed with <span Class="emphasis">0</span> to force each term to have the same width. When either <span Class="emphasis">x</span> or </span>y</span> begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary. When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicographically between <span Class="emphasis">x</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span>, inclusive, using the default C locale. Note that both <span Class="emphasis">x</span> and <span Class="emphasis">y</span> must be of the same type. When the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate. 
<p class="level0">Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces. 
<p class="level0">A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged. A <a class="bold" href="#">{</a> or <a class="bold" href="#">,</a> may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string <a class="bold" href="#">${</a> is not considered eligible for brace expansion. 
<p class="level0">This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs} 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level1">chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}} 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with historical versions of <span Class="manpage">sh .</span><span Class="bold">sh</span> does not treat opening or closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For example, a word entered to <span Class="bold">sh</span> as <span Class="emphasis">file{1,2}</span> appears identically in the output.  The same word is output as <span Class="emphasis">file1 file2</span> after expansion by <span Class="manpage">bash .</span>If strict compatibility with <span Class="bold">sh</span> is desired, start <span Class="bold">bash</span> with the <span Class="bold">+B </span> option or disable brace expansion with the <span Class="bold">+B</span> option to the <span Class="bold">set</span> command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). <a name="Tilde"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Tilde Expansion</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`<a class="bold" href="#">~</a>'), all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there is no unquoted slash) are considered a <span Class="emphasis">tilde-prefix</span>. If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible <span Class="emphasis">login name</span>. If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">HOME .</span>If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOME</span> is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name. 
<p class="level0">If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PWD</span> replaces the tilde-prefix. If the tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of the shell variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">OLDPWD</span>if it is set, is substituted. If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number <span Class="emphasis">N</span>, optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-', the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the <span Class="bold">dirs</span> builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an argument. If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is assumed. 
<p class="level0">If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is unchanged. 
<p class="level0">Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately following a <a class="bold" href="#">:</a> or the first <a class="manpage" href="#">= .</a>In these cases, tilde expansion is also performed. Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in assignments to

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The `<a class="bold" href="#">$</a>' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which could be interpreted as part of the name. 
<p class="level0">When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the first `<a class="bold" href="#">}</a>' not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter expansion. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">${<span Class="emphasis">parameter</span>} The value of <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> is substituted.  The braces are required when <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> is followed by a character which is not to be interpreted as part of its name. The <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> is a shell parameter as described above <a class="bold" href="#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a>) or an array reference (<a class="bold" href="#Arrays">Arrays</a>). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">If the first character of <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> is an exclamation point (<a class="bold" href="#">!</a>), it introduces a level of variable indirection. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> uses the value of the variable formed from the rest of <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> as the name of the variable; this variable is then expanded and that value is used in the rest of the substitution, rather than the value of <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> itself. This is known as <span Class="emphasis">indirect expansion</span>. The exceptions to this are the expansions of ${<a class="bold" href="#">!</a><span Class="emphasis">prefix</span><a class="bold" href="#">*</a>} and ${<a class="bold" href="#">!</a><span Class="emphasis">name</span>[<a class="emphasis" href="#">@</a>]} described below. The exclamation point must immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce indirection. 
<p class="level0">In each of the cases below, <span Class="emphasis">word</span> is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. 
<p class="level0">When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented below (e.g., <span Class="bold">:-</span>), <span Class="bold">bash</span> tests for a parameter that is unset or null.  Omitting the colon results in a test only for a parameter that is unset.

If <span Class="emphasis">length</span> is omitted, expands to the substring of the value of <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> starting at the character specified by <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> and extending to the end of the value. <span Class="emphasis">length</span> and <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> are arithmetic expressions (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#"></a> ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below). 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as an offset in characters from the end of the value of <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">length</span> evaluates to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as an offset in characters from the end of the value of <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is the characters between <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> and that result. Note that a negative offset must be separated from the colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the <span Class="bold">:-</span> expansion. 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> is <a class="bold" href="#">@</a>, the result is <span Class="emphasis">length</span> positional parameters beginning at <span Class="emphasis">offset</span>. A negative <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> is taken relative to one greater than the greatest positional parameter, so an offset of -1 evaluates to the last positional parameter. It is an expansion error if <span Class="emphasis">length</span> evaluates to a number less than zero. 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">parameter</span> is an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *, the result is the <span Class="emphasis">length</span> members of the array beginning with ${<span Class="emphasis">parameter</span>[<span Class="emphasis">offset</span>]}. A negative <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> is taken relative to one greater than the maximum index of the specified array.

<p class="level0">Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined results. 
<p class="level0">Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters  are used, in which case the indexing starts at 1 by default. If <span Class="emphasis">offset</span> is 0, and the positional parameters are used, <span Class="bold">$0</span> is prefixed to the list.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a class="emphasis" href="#Command">Command substitution</a> allows the output of a command to replace the command name.  There are two forms: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">$(</a><span Class="emphasis">command</span>|<a class="bold" href="#">)</a> 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">`</a><span Class="emphasis">command</span><a class="bold" href="#">`</a> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> performs the expansion by executing <span Class="emphasis">command</span> and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting. The command substitution <span class="bold">$(cat <span Class="emphasis">file</span>)</span> can be replaced by the equivalent but faster <span class="bold">$(&lt; <span Class="emphasis">file</span>)</span>. 
<p class="level0">When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used, backslash retains its literal meaning except when followed by <a class="manpage" href="#">$</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#">\`</a>or <span Class="manpage">\e .</span>The first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution. When using the $(^<span Class="emphasis">command</span>|) form, all characters between the parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially. 
<p class="level0">Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the backquoted form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes. 
<p class="level0">If the substitution appears within double quotes, word splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the results. <a name="Arithmetic"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Arithmetic Expansion</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and the substitution of the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">$((</a><span Class="emphasis">expression</span><a class="bold" href="#">))</a> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The old format <a class="bold" href="#">$[</a><span Class="emphasis">expression</span><a class="bold" href="#">]</a> is deprecated and will be removed in upcoming versions of bash. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">expression</span> is treated as if it were within double quotes, but a double quote inside the parentheses is not treated specially. All tokens in the expression undergo parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal. The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be evaluated. Arithmetic expansions may be nested. 
<p class="level0">The evaluation is performed according to the rules listed below under 
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#ARITHMETIC">ARITHMETIC EVALUATION .</a>If <span Class="emphasis">expression</span> is invalid, <span Class="bold">bash</span> prints a message indicating failure and no substitution occurs. <a name="Process"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Process Substitution</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a class="emphasis" href="#Process">Process substitution</a> is supported on systems that support named pipes (<span Class="emphasis">FIFOs</span>) or the <span Class="bold">/dev/fd</span> method of naming open files. It takes the form of <span Class="bold">&lt;(</span><span Class="emphasis">list^</span><a class="bold" href="#">)</a> or <span Class="bold">&gt;(</span><span Class="emphasis">list^</span><a class="bold" href="#">)</a>. The process <span Class="emphasis">list</span> is run with its input or output connected to a <span Class="emphasis">FIFO</span> or some file in <span Class="bold">/dev/fd</span>.  The name of this file is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion.  If the <span Class="bold">&gt;(</span><span Class="emphasis">list^</span><a class="bold" href="#">)</a> form is used, writing to the file will provide input for <span Class="emphasis">list</span>.  If the <span Class="bold">&lt;(</span><span Class="emphasis">list^</span><a class="bold" href="#">)</a> form is used, the file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the output of <span Class="emphasis">list</span>. 
<p class="level0">When available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with parameter and variable expansion,  command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. <a name="Word"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Word Splitting</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for <span Class="emphasis">word splitting .</span> 
<p class="level0">The shell treats each character of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions into words using these characters as field terminators. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> is unset, or its value is exactly <span Class="manpage">&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</span>the default, then sequences of <span Class="manpage">&lt;space&gt;</span>, <span Class="manpage">&lt;tab&gt;</span>and <span Class="bold">&lt;newline&gt;</span> at the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions are ignored, and any sequence of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> has a value other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters <span Class="bold">space</span> and <span Class="bold">tab</span> are ignored at the beginning and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">IFS</span>(an 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> whitespace character). Any character in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> that is not 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> whitespace, along with any adjacent 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> whitespace characters, delimits a field. A sequence of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter. If the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> is null, no word splitting occurs. 
<p class="level0">Explicit null arguments (^f3"^"</span> or ^f3(aq^(aq</span>^) are retained. Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed. If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument results and is retained. 
<p class="level0">Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed. <a name="Pathname"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Pathname Expansion</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">After word splitting, unless the <span Class="bold">-f</span> option has been set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> scans each word for the characters <a class="manpage" href="#">*</a>, <a class="manpage" href="#">?</a>and <a class="manpage" href="#">[ .</a>If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a <span Class="emphasis">pattern ,</span> and replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Pattern Matching</span> below). If no matching filenames are found, and the shell option <span Class="bold">nullglob</span> is not enabled, the word is left unchanged. If the  <span Class="bold">nullglob</span> option is set, and no matches are found, the word is removed. If the <span Class="bold">failglob</span> shell option is set, and no matches are found, an error message is printed and the command is not executed. If the shell option <span Class="bold">nocaseglob</span> is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. Note that when using range expressions like [a-z] (see below), letters of the other case may be included, depending on the setting of <span Class="bold">LC_COLLATE.</span> When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character <a class="bold" href="#">``.''</a> at the start of a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option <span Class="bold">dotglob</span> is set. When matching a pathname, the slash character must always be matched explicitly. In other cases, the <a class="bold" href="#">``.''</a> character is not treated specially.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GLOBIGNORE</span> is removed from the list of matches. The filenames <a class="bold" href="#">``.''</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">``..''</a> are always ignored when 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GLOBIGNORE</span> is set and not null.  However, setting 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GLOBIGNORE</span> to a non-null value has the effect of enabling the <span Class="bold">dotglob</span> shell option, so all other filenames beginning with a <a class="bold" href="#">``.''</a> will match. To get the old behavior of ignoring filenames beginning with a <a class="manpage" href="#">``.''</a>make <a class="bold" href="#">``.*''</a> one of the patterns in

<p class="level0">If the <span Class="bold">extglob</span> shell option is enabled using the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin, several extended pattern matching operators are recognized. In the following description, a <span Class="emphasis">pattern-list</span> is a list of one or more patterns separated by a <a class="bold" href="#">|</a>.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters <span Class="manpage">\e</span>, <span Class="manpage">\(aq</span>and ^f3"</span>^ that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed. <a name="REDIRECTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">REDIRECTION</h2>
<p class="level0">Before a command is executed, its input and output may be <span Class="emphasis">redirected</span> using a special notation interpreted by the shell. Redirection allows commands' file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to refer to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and writes to. Redirection may also be used to modify file handles in the current shell execution environment. The following redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a <span Class="emphasis">simple command</span> or may follow a <span Class="emphasis">command .</span> Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from left to right. 
<p class="level0">Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may instead be preceded by a word of the form {<span Class="emphasis">varname</span>}. In this case, for each redirection operator except &gt;&- and &lt;&-, the shell will allocate a file descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and assign it to <span Class="emphasis">varname</span>. If &gt;&- or &lt;&- is preceded by {<span Class="emphasis">varname</span>}, the value of <span Class="emphasis">varname</span> defines the file descriptor to close. 
<p class="level0">In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <span Class="manpage">&lt;</span>the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0).  If the first character of the redirection operator is <span Class="manpage">&gt;</span>the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1). 
<p class="level0">The word following the redirection operator in the following descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting. If it expands to more than one word, <span Class="bold">bash</span> reports an error. 
<p class="level0">Note that the order of redirections is significant.  For example,  the command 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">ls <span Class="bold">&gt;</span> dirlist 2<span Class="bold">&gt;&</span>1 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">directs both standard output and standard error to the file  <span Class="emphasis">dirlist ,</span> while the command 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">ls 2<span Class="bold">&gt;&</span>1 <span Class="bold">&gt;</span> dirlist 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">directs only the standard output to file <span Class="emphasis">dirlist ,</span> because the standard error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard output was redirected to <span Class="emphasis">dirlist .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> handles several filenames specially when they are used in redirections, as described in the following table: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">/dev/fd/fd</span> If <span Class="emphasis">fd</span> is a valid integer, file descriptor <span Class="emphasis">fd</span> is duplicated. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">/dev/stdin</span> File descriptor 0 is duplicated. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">/dev/stdout</span> File descriptor 1 is duplicated. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">/dev/stderr</span> File descriptor 2 is duplicated. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">/dev/tcp/host/port</span> If <span Class="emphasis">host</span> is a valid hostname or Internet address, and <span Class="emphasis">port</span> is an integer port number or service name, <span Class="bold">bash</span> attempts to open the corresponding TCP socket. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">/dev/udp/host/port</span> If <span Class="emphasis">host</span> is a valid hostname or Internet address, and <span Class="emphasis">port</span> is an integer port number or service name, <span Class="bold">bash</span> attempts to open the corresponding UDP socket. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail. 
<p class="level0">Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with care, as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses internally. 
<p class="level0">Note that the <span Class="bold">exec</span> builtin command can make redirections take effect in the current shell. <a name="Redirecting"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Redirecting Input</h2>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">is used to duplicate input file descriptors. If <span Class="emphasis">word</span> expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is made to be a copy of that file descriptor.

If the file does not exist, it is created. <a name="ALIASES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ALIASES</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Aliases</span> allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command. The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the <span Class="bold">alias</span> and <span Class="bold">unalias</span> builtin commands (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so, that word is replaced by the text of the alias. The characters <a class="bold" href="#">/</a>, <a class="bold" href="#">$</a>, <a class="bold" href="#">`</a>, and <a class="bold" href="#">=</a> and any of the shell <span Class="emphasis">metacharacters</span> or quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias name. The replacement text may contain any valid shell input, including shell metacharacters. The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second time. This means that one may alias <span Class="bold">ls</span> to <span Class="manpage">ls -F</span>for instance, and <span Class="bold">bash</span> does not try to recursively expand the replacement text. If the last character of the alias value is a <span Class="emphasis">blank ,</span> then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion. 
<p class="level0">Aliases are created and listed with the <span Class="bold">alias</span> command, and removed with the <span Class="bold">unalias</span> command. 
<p class="level0">There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text. If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a> below). 
<p class="level0">Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the <span Class="bold">expand_aliases</span> shell option is set using <span Class="bold">shopt</span> (see the description of <span Class="bold">shopt</span> under 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). 
<p class="level0">The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> always reads at least one complete line of input before executing any of the commands on that line.  Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input is read. The commands following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias. This behavior is also an issue when functions are executed. Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a compound command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after that function is executed.  To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use <span Class="bold">alias</span> in compound commands. 
<p class="level0">For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions. <a name="FUNCTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FUNCTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">A shell function, defined as described above under 
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#SHELL">SHELL GRAMMAR</a>stores a series of commands for later execution. When the name of a shell function is used as a simple command name, the list of commands associated with that function name is executed. Functions are executed in the context of the current shell; no new process is created to interpret them (contrast this with the execution of a shell script). When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the positional parameters during its execution. The special parameter <a class="bold" href="#">#</a> is updated to reflect the change.  Special parameter <span Class="bold">0</span> is unchanged. The first element of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FUNCNAME</span> variable is set to the name of the function while the function is executing. 
<p class="level0">All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a function and its caller with these exceptions:  the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">DEBUG</span> and <span Class="bold">RETURN</span> traps (see the description of the <span Class="bold">trap</span> builtin under 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below) are not inherited unless the function has been given the <span Class="bold">trace</span> attribute (see the description of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">declare</span> builtin below) or the <span Class="bold">-o functrace</span> shell option has been enabled with the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin (in which case all functions inherit the <span Class="bold">DEBUG</span> and <span Class="bold">RETURN</span> traps), and the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ERR</span> trap is not inherited unless the <span Class="bold">-o errtrace</span> shell option has been enabled. 
<p class="level0">Variables local to the function may be declared with the <span Class="bold">local</span> builtin command.  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the function and its caller. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">FUNCNEST</span> variable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed the limit cause the entire command to abort. 
<p class="level0">If the builtin command <span Class="bold">return</span> is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call. Any command associated with the <span Class="bold">RETURN</span> trap is executed before execution resumes. When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter <a class="bold" href="#">#</a> are restored to the values they had prior to the function's execution. 
<p class="level0">Function names and definitions may be listed with the <span Class="bold">-f</span> option to the <span Class="bold">declare</span> or <span Class="bold">typeset</span> builtin commands.  The <span Class="bold">-F</span> option to <span Class="bold">declare</span> or <span Class="bold">typeset</span> will list the function names only (and optionally the source file and line number, if the <span Class="bold">extdebug</span> shell option is enabled). Functions may be exported so that subshells automatically have them defined with the <span Class="bold">-f</span> option to the  <span Class="bold">export</span> builtin. A function definition may be deleted using the <span Class="bold">-f</span> option to the <span Class="bold">unset</span> builtin. Note that shell functions and variables with the same name may result in multiple identically-named entries in the environment passed to the shell's children. Care should be taken in cases where this may cause a problem. 
<p class="level0">Functions may be recursive. The <span Class="bold">FUNCNEST</span> variable may be used to limit the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number of function invocations. By default, no limit is imposed on the number of recursive calls. <a name="ARITHMETIC"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ARITHMETIC EVALUATION</h2>
<p class="level0">The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain circumstances (see the <span Class="bold">let</span> and <span Class="bold">declare</span> builtin commands and <a class="bold" href="#Arithmetic">Arithmetic Expansion</a>). Evaluation is done in fixed-width integers with no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error. The operators and their precedence, associativity, and values are the same as in the C language. The following list of operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators. The levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated. Within an expression, shell variables may also be referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax. A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax. The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the <span Class="emphasis">integer</span> attribute using <span Class="bold">declare -i</span> is assigned a value. A null value evaluates to 0. A shell variable need not have its <span Class="emphasis">integer</span> attribute turned on to be used in an expression. 
<p class="level0">Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers. A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal. Otherwise, numbers take the form [<span Class="emphasis">base&#35;</span>]n, where the optional <span Class="emphasis">base</span> is a decimal number between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is a number in that base. If <span Class="emphasis">base&#35;</span> is omitted, then base 10 is used. When specifying <span Class="emphasis">n</span>, the digits greater&lt; than 9 are represented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order. If <span Class="emphasis">base</span> is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.

<p class="level0">Conditional expressions are used by the <a class="bold" href="#">[[</a> compound command and the <span Class="bold">test</span> and <a class="bold" href="#">[</a> builtin commands to test file attributes and perform string and arithmetic comparisons. Expressions are formed from the following unary or binary primaries. If any <span Class="emphasis">file</span> argument to one of the primaries is of the form <span Class="emphasis">/dev/fd/n</span>, then file descriptor <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is checked.

<p class="level0"><a name="SIMPLE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION</h2>
<p class="level0">When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right. 
<p class="level0"><a name="1"></a><span class="nroffip">1.</span> 
<p class="level1">The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later processing. 
<p class="level0"><a name="2"></a><span class="nroffip">2.</span> 
<p class="level1">The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded.  If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words are the arguments. 
<p class="level0"><a name="3"></a><span class="nroffip">3.</span> 
<p class="level1">Redirections are performed as described above under 
<p class="level1"><a class="manpage" href="#REDIRECTION">REDIRECTION .</a>
<p class="level0"><a name="4"></a><span class="nroffip">4.</span> 
<p class="level1">The text after the <a class="bold" href="#">=</a> in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable. 
<p class="level1">If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current shell environment.  Otherwise, the variables are added to the environment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell environment. If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero status. 
<p class="level1">If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not affect the current shell environment.  A redirection error causes the command to exit with a non-zero status. 
<p class="level1">If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.  If one of the expansions contained a command substitution, the exit status of the command is the exit status of the last command substitution performed.  If there were no command substitutions, the command exits with a status of zero. <a name="COMMAND"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMMAND EXECUTION</h2>
<p class="level0">After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken. 
<p class="level0">If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked as described above in 
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS .</a>If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found, that builtin is invoked. 
<p class="level0">If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, <span Class="bold">bash</span> searches each element of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> for a directory containing an executable file by that name. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> uses a hash table to remember the full pathnames of executable files (see <span Class="bold">hash</span> under 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). A full search of the directories in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> is performed only if the command is not found in the hash table. If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell function named <span Class="bold">command_not_found_handle</span>. If that function exists, it is invoked with the original command and the original command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit status becomes the exit status of the shell. If that function is not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit status of 127. 
<p class="level0">If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution environment. Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any. 
<p class="level0">If this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a <span Class="emphasis">shell script</span>, a file containing shell commands.  A subshell is spawned to execute it.  This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see <span Class="bold">hash</span> below under 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a>) are retained by the child. 
<p class="level0">If the program is a file beginning with <a class="manpage" href="#">#!</a>the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this executable format themselves.  The arguments to the  interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if any. <a name="COMMAND"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">The shell has an <span Class="emphasis">execution environment</span>, which consists of the following: 
<p class="level0"><a name="bu"></a><span class="nroffip">\(bu</span> 
<p class="level1">open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by redirections supplied to the <span Class="bold">exec</span> builtin

<p class="level0"><a name="bu"></a><span class="nroffip">\(bu</span> 
<p class="level1">options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line arguments) or by <span Class="bold">set</span>

<p class="level1">various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of <a class="bold" href="#">$$</a>, and the value of 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">PPID</span> 
<p class="level1">When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists of the following.  Unless otherwise noted, the values are inherited from the shell. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="bu"></a><span class="nroffip">\(bu</span> 
<p class="level1">the shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by redirections to the command

<p class="level0"><a name="bu"></a><span class="nroffip">\(bu</span> 
<p class="level1">shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables exported for the command, passed in the environment 
<p class="level0"><a name="bu"></a><span class="nroffip">\(bu</span> 
<p class="level1">traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored 
<p class="level1">A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.  
<p class="level1">Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the shell are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent at invocation.  Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline are also executed in a subshell environment.  Changes made to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment. 
<p class="level1">Subshells spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of the <span Class="bold">-e</span> option from the parent shell.  When not in <span Class="emphasis">posix</span> mode, <span Class="bold">bash</span> clears the <span Class="bold">-e</span> option in such subshells. 
<p class="level1">If a command is followed by a <a class="bold" href="#">&</a> and job control is not active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file <span Class="emphasis">/dev/null</span>. Otherwise, the invoked command inherits the file descriptors of the calling shell as modified by redirections. <a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the <span Class="emphasis">environment .</span> This is a list of  <span Class="emphasis">name</span>-<span Class="emphasis">value</span> pairs, of the form <span Class="emphasis">name\fR=\fPvalue .</span> 
<p class="level0">The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking it for <span Class="emphasis">export</span> to child processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment. The <span Class="bold">export</span> and <span Class="bold">declare -x</span> commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing the old.  The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the <span Class="bold">unset</span> command, plus any additions via the <span Class="bold">export</span> and <span Class="bold">declare -x</span> commands. 
<p class="level0">The environment for any <span Class="emphasis">simple command</span> or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described above in 
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS .</a>These assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command. 
<p class="level0">If the  <span Class="bold">-k</span> option is set (see the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command below), then <span Class="emphasis">all</span> parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name. 
<p class="level0">When <span Class="bold">bash</span> invokes an external command, the variable <a class="bold" href="#">_</a> is set to the full filename of the command and passed to that command in its environment. <a name="EXIT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EXIT STATUS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the <span Class="emphasis">waitpid</span> system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell may use values above 125 specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited to this range. Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to indicate specific failure modes. 
<p class="level0">For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a  zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit status of zero indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indicates failure. When a command terminates on a fatal signal <span Class="emphasis">N</span>, <span Class="bold">bash</span> uses the value of 128+<span Class="emphasis">N</span> as the exit status. 
<p class="level0">If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126. 
<p class="level0">If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero. 
<p class="level0">Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (<span Class="emphasis">true</span>) if successful, and non-zero (<span Class="emphasis">false</span>) if an error occurs while they execute.  All builtins return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.  See also the <span Class="bold">exit</span> builtin command below. <a name="SIGNALS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SIGNALS</h2>
<p class="level0">When <span Class="bold">bash</span> is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGTERM</span> (so that <span Class="bold">kill 0</span> does not kill an interactive shell), and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGINT</span> is caught and handled (so that the <span Class="bold">wait</span> builtin is interruptible). In all cases, <span Class="bold">bash</span> ignores 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGQUIT .</span>If job control is in effect, <span Class="bold">bash</span> ignores 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGTTIN</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGTTOU</span>and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGTSTP .</span>
<p class="level0">Non-builtin commands run by <span Class="bold">bash</span> have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGINT</span> and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGQUIT</span> in addition to these inherited handlers. Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGTTIN</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGTTOU</span>and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGTSTP .</span>
<p class="level0">The shell exits by default upon receipt of a 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGHUP .</span>Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGHUP</span> to all jobs, running or stopped. Stopped jobs are sent 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGCONT</span> to ensure that they receive the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGHUP .</span>To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it should be removed from the jobs table with the  <span Class="bold">disown</span> builtin (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below) or marked  to not receive 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGHUP</span> using <span Class="manpage">disown -h .</span>
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="bold">huponexit</span> shell option has been set with <span Class="manpage">shopt</span><span Class="bold">bash</span> sends a  
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGHUP</span> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits. 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="bold">bash</span> is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the command completes.  When <span Class="bold">bash</span> is waiting for an asynchronous command via the <span Class="bold">wait</span> builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the <span Class="bold">wait</span> builtin to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed. <a name="JOB"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">JOB CONTROL</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Job control</span> refers to the ability to selectively stop (<span Class="emphasis">suspend</span>) the execution of processes and continue (<span Class="emphasis">resume</span>) their execution at a later point.  A user typically employs this facility via an interactive interface supplied jointly by the operating system kernel's terminal driver and <span Class="manpage">bash .</span>
<p class="level0">The shell associates a <span Class="emphasis">job</span> with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the <span Class="bold">jobs</span> command.  When <span Class="bold">bash</span> starts a job asynchronously (in the <span Class="emphasis">background ),</span> it prints a line that looks like: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">[1] 25647 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647. All of the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> uses the <span Class="emphasis">job</span> abstraction as the basis for job control. 
<p class="level0">To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control, the operating system maintains the notion of a <span class="emphasis">current terminal process group ID</span>.  Members of this process group (processes whose process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">SIGINT .</span>These processes are said to be in the <span Class="emphasis">foreground .</span> <span Class="emphasis">Background</span> processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals. Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so specifies with f(CWstty tostop</span>, write to the terminal. Background processes which attempt to read from (write to when f(CWstty tostop</span> is in effect) the terminal are sent a  
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU)</span> signal by the kernel's terminal driver,  which, unless caught, suspends the process. 
<p class="level0">If the operating system on which <span Class="bold">bash</span> is running supports job control, <span Class="bold">bash</span> contains facilities to use it. Typing the <span Class="emphasis">suspend</span> character (typically <span Class="manpage">^Z</span>Control-Z) while a process is running causes that process to be stopped and returns control to  <span Class="manpage">bash .</span>Typing the <span Class="emphasis">delayed suspend</span> character (typically <span Class="manpage">^Y</span>Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to be returned to <span Class="manpage">bash .</span>The user may then manipulate the state of this job, using the <span Class="bold">bg</span> command to continue it in the background, the <span Class="bold">fg</span> command to continue it in the foreground, or the <span Class="bold">kill</span> command to kill it.  A <span Class="bold">^Z</span> takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing pending output and typeahead to be discarded. 
<p class="level0">There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell. The character <a class="bold" href="#">%</a> introduces a job specification (<span Class="emphasis">jobspec</span>).  Job number <span Class="emphasis">n</span> may be referred to as <span Class="manpage">%n .</span>A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line. For example, <span Class="bold">%ce</span> refers to a stopped <span Class="bold">ce</span> job.  If a prefix matches more than one job, <span Class="bold">bash</span> reports an error.  Using <span Class="manpage">%?ce</span>on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string <span Class="bold">ce</span> in its command line.  If the substring matches more than one job, <span Class="bold">bash</span> reports an error.  The symbols <a class="bold" href="#">%%</a> and <a class="bold" href="#">%+</a> refer to the shell's notion of the <span Class="emphasis">current job ,</span> which is the last job stopped while it was in the foreground or started in the background. The  <span Class="emphasis">previous job</span> may be referenced using <span Class="manpage">%- .</span>If there is only a single job, <a class="bold" href="#">%+</a> and <span Class="bold">%-</span> can both be used to refer to that job. In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the <span Class="bold">jobs</span> command), the current job is always flagged with a <a class="manpage" href="#">+</a>and the previous job with a <span Class="manpage">- .</span>A single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job. 
<p class="level0">Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: <a class="bold" href="#1">%1</a> is a synonym for <span Class="bold">``fg %1''</span>, bringing job 1 from the background into the foreground. Similarly, <a class="bold" href="#1">``%1 &''</a> resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to <span Class="bold">``bg %1''</span>. 
<p class="level0">The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state. Normally, <span Class="bold">bash</span> waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output.  If the  <span Class="bold">-b</span> option to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command is enabled, <span Class="bold">bash</span> reports such changes immediately. Any trap on 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SIGCHLD</span> is executed for each child that exits. 
<p class="level0">If an attempt to exit <span Class="bold">bash</span> is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the <span Class="bold">checkjobs</span> shell option has been enabled using the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin, running), the shell prints a warning message, and, if the <span Class="bold">checkjobs</span> option is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses. The <span Class="bold">jobs</span> command may then be used to inspect their status.  If a second attempt to exit is made without an intervening command, the shell does not print another warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated. <a name="PROMPTING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PROMPTING</h2>
<p class="level0">When executing interactively,  <span Class="bold">bash</span> displays the primary prompt 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS1</span> when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PS2</span> when it needs more input to complete a command. <span Class="bold">Bash</span> allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ea</span> an ASCII bell character (07) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ed</span> the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26") 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\eD{format}</span> the <span Class="emphasis">format</span> is passed to <span Class="emphasis">strftime</span>(3) and the result is inserted into the prompt string; an empty <span Class="emphasis">format</span> results in a locale-specific time representation.  The braces are required 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ee</span> an ASCII escape character (033) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\eh</span> the hostname up to the first `.'

<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The command number and the history number are usually different: the history number of a command is its position in the history list, which may include commands restored from the history file (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a> below), while the command number is the position in the sequence of commands executed during the current shell session. After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the <span Class="bold">promptvars</span> shell option (see the description of the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> command under 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). <a name="READLINE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">READLINE</h2>
<p class="level0">This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive shell, unless the <span Class="bold">--noediting</span> option is given at shell invocation. Line editing is also used when using the <span Class="bold">-e</span> option to the <span Class="bold">read</span> builtin. By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of Emacs. A vi-style line editing interface is also available. Line editing can be enabled at any time using the <span Class="bold">-o emacs</span> or <span Class="bold">-o vi</span> options to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). To turn off line editing after the shell is running, use the <span Class="bold">+o emacs</span> or <span Class="bold">+o vi</span> options to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin. <a name="Readline"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Readline Notation</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In this section, the Emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C-<span Class="emphasis">key</span>, e.g., C-n means Control-N.  Similarly,  <span Class="emphasis">meta</span> keys are denoted by M-<span Class="emphasis">key</span>, so M-x means Meta-X.  (On keyboards without a  <span Class="emphasis">meta</span> key, M-<span Class="emphasis">x</span> means ESC <span Class="emphasis">x</span>, i.e., press the Escape key then the <span Class="emphasis">x</span> key.  This makes ESC the <span Class="emphasis">meta prefix</span>. The combination M-C-<span Class="emphasis">x</span> means ESC-Control-<span Class="emphasis">x</span>, or press the Escape key then hold the Control key while pressing the <span Class="emphasis">x</span> key.) 
<p class="level0">Readline commands may be given numeric <span Class="emphasis">arguments ,</span> which normally act as a repeat count. Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that is significant. Passing a negative argument to a command that acts in the forward direction (e.g., <span Class="bold">kill-line</span>) causes that command to act in a backward direction.  Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted below. 
<p class="level0">When a command is described as <span Class="emphasis">killing</span> text, the text deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (<span Class="emphasis">yanking</span>).  The killed text is saved in a <span Class="emphasis">kill ring</span>.  Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring. <a name="Readline"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Readline Initialization</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file (the <span Class="emphasis">inputrc</span> file). The name of this file is taken from the value of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">INPUTRC</span> variable.  If that variable is unset, the default is <span Class="emphasis">~/.inputrc .</span> When a program which uses the readline library starts up, the initialization file is read, and the key bindings and variables are set. There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the readline initialization file. Blank lines are ignored. Lines beginning with a <span Class="bold">&#35;</span> are comments. Lines beginning with a <a class="bold" href="#">$</a> indicate conditional constructs. Other lines denote key bindings and variable settings. 
<p class="level0">The default key-bindings may be changed with an <span Class="emphasis">inputrc </span> file. Other programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings. 
<p class="level0">For example, placing 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">M-Control-u: universal-argument 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level1">C-Meta-u: universal-argument 
<p class="level0">into the  <span Class="emphasis">inputrc</span> would make M-C-u execute the readline command <span Class="emphasis">universal-argument .</span> 
<p class="level0">The following symbolic character names are recognized: <span Class="emphasis">RUBOUT ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">DEL ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">ESC ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">LFD ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">NEWLINE ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">RET ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">RETURN ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">SPC ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">SPACE ,</span> and <span Class="emphasis">TAB .</span> 
<p class="level0">In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <span Class="emphasis">macro</span>). <a name="Readline"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Readline Key Bindings</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <span Class="emphasis">inputrc</span> file is simple.  All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name may be specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with <span Class="emphasis">Meta-</span> or <span Class="emphasis">Control-</span> prefixes, or as a key sequence. 
<p class="level0">When using the form <span Class="bold">keyname</span>:^<span Class="emphasis">function-name</span> or <span Class="emphasis">macro</span>, <span Class="emphasis">keyname</span> is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">Control-u: universal-argument <br>Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word <br>Control-o: "&gt; output" 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In the above example, <span Class="emphasis">C-u</span> is bound to the function <span Class="manpage">universal-argument</span><span Class="emphasis">M-DEL</span> is bound to the function <span Class="manpage">backward-kill-word</span>and <span Class="emphasis">C-o</span> is bound to run the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">into the line). 
<p class="level0">In the second form, <span Class="bold">"keyseq"</span>:^<span Class="emphasis">function-name</span> or <span Class="emphasis">macro</span>, <span Class="bold">keyseq</span> differs from <span Class="bold">keyname</span> above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the sequence within double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the symbolic character names are not recognized. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">"eC-u": universal-argument <br>"eC-xeC-r": re-read-init-file <br>"ee[11~": "Function Key 1" 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In this example, <span Class="emphasis">C-u</span> is again bound to the function <span Class="manpage">universal-argument .</span><span Class="emphasis">C-x C-r</span> is bound to the function <span Class="manpage">re-read-init-file</span>and  <span Class="emphasis">ESC [ 1 1 ~</span> is bound to insert the text 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\eC-</span> control prefix 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\eM-</span> meta prefix 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ee</span> an escape character 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\e\e</span> backslash 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\e</span> literal " 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\e\(aq</span> literal (aq 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of backslash escapes is available: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ea</span> alert (bell) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\eb</span> backspace 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ed</span> delete 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ef</span> form feed 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\en</span> newline 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\er</span> carriage return 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\et</span> horizontal tab 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ev</span> vertical tab 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\ennn</span> the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <span Class="emphasis">nnn</span> (one to three digits) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">\exHH</span> the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <span Class="emphasis">HH</span> (one or two hex digits) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used to indicate a macro definition. Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name. In the macro body, the backslash escapes described above are expanded. Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text, including " and (aq. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Bash</span> allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or modified with the <span Class="bold">bind</span> builtin command.  The editing mode may be switched during interactive use by using the <span Class="bold">-o</span> option to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below). <a name="Readline"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Readline Variables</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.  A variable may be set in the <span Class="emphasis">inputrc</span> file with a statement of the form 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">set</span> <span Class="emphasis">variable-name</span> <span Class="emphasis">value</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Except where noted, readline variables can take the values <span Class="bold">On</span> or <span Class="bold">Off</span> (without regard to case). Unrecognized variable names are ignored. When a variable value is read, empty or null values, "on" (case-insensitive), and "1" are equivalent to <span Class="bold">On</span>.  All other values are equivalent to <span Class="bold">Off</span>. The variables and their default values are: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">bell-style (audible)</span> Controls what happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell. If set to <span Class="bold">none</span>, readline never rings the bell.  If set to <span Class="bold">visible</span>, readline uses a visible bell if one is available. If set to <span Class="bold">audible</span>, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">bind-tty-special-chars (On)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline attempts to bind the control characters treated specially by the kernel's terminal driver to their readline equivalents. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">colored-stats (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type.      The color definitions are taken from the value of the <span Class="bold">LS_COLORS</span> environment variable. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">comment-begin (``#'')</span> The string that is inserted when the readline <span Class="bold">insert-comment</span> command is executed. This command is bound to <span Class="bold">M-#</span> in emacs mode and to <a class="bold" href="#">#</a> in vi command mode. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">completion-ignore-case (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">completion-prefix-display-length (0)</span> The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed without modification.  When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">completion-query-items (100)</span> This determines when the user is queried about viewing the number of possible completions generated by the <span Class="bold">possible-completions</span> command. It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal to zero.  If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to the value of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes to view them; otherwise they are simply listed on the terminal. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">convert-meta (On)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an escape character (in effect, using escape as the <span Class="emphasis">meta prefix</span>). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">disable-completion (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline will inhibit word completion.  Completion characters will be inserted into the line as if they had been mapped to <span Class="bold">self-insert</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">editing-mode (emacs)</span> Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar to <span Class="emphasis">Emacs</span> or <span Class="emphasis">vi</span>. <span Class="bold">editing-mode</span> can be set to either <span Class="bold">emacs</span> or <span Class="manpage">vi .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">echo-control-characters (On)</span> When set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, on operating systems that indicate they support it, readline echoes a character corresponding to a signal generated from the keyboard. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">enable-keypad (Off)</span> When set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline will try to enable the application keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">enable-meta-key (On)</span> When set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is called.  On many terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">expand-tilde (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, tilde expansion is performed when readline attempts word completion. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">history-preserve-point (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, the history code attempts to place point at the same location on each history line retrieved with <span Class="bold">previous-history</span> or <span Class="bold">next-history</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">history-size (0)</span> Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list. If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted and no new entries are saved. If set to a value less than zero, the number of history entries is not limited. By default, the number of history entries is not limited. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)</span> When set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping to a new line. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">input-meta (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not strip the high bit from the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The name <span Class="bold">meta-flag</span> is a synonym for this variable. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">isearch-terminators (``C-[C-J'')</span> The string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without subsequently executing the character as a command. If this variable has not been given a value, the characters <span Class="emphasis">ESC</span> and <span Class="emphasis">C-J</span> will terminate an incremental search. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">keymap (emacs)</span> Set the current readline keymap.  The set of valid keymap names is <span class="emphasis">emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-command</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">vi-insert .</span> <span Class="emphasis">vi</span> is equivalent to <span Class="emphasis">vi-command</span>; <span Class="emphasis">emacs</span> is equivalent to <span Class="emphasis">emacs-standard</span>.  The default value is <span Class="emphasis">emacs ;</span> the value of <span Class="bold">editing-mode</span> also affects the default keymap. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">keyseq-timeout (500)</span> Specifies the duration <span Class="emphasis">readline</span> will wait for a character when reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete key sequence using the input read so far, or can take additional input to complete a longer key sequence). If no input is received within the timeout, <span Class="emphasis">readline</span> will use the shorter but complete key sequence. The value is specified in milliseconds, so a value of 1000 means that <span Class="emphasis">readline</span> will wait one second for additional input. If this variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value, <span Class="emphasis">readline</span> will wait until another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">mark-directories (On)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, completed directory names have a slash appended. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">mark-modified-lines (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, history lines that have been modified are displayed with a preceding asterisk (<a class="bold" href="#">*</a>). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">mark-symlinked-directories (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of <span Class="bold">mark-directories</span>). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">match-hidden-files (On)</span> This variable, when set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, causes readline to match files whose names begin with a `.' (hidden files) when performing filename  completion. If set to <span Class="bold">Off</span>, the leading `.' must be supplied by the user in the filename to be completed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">menu-complete-display-prefix (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through the list. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">output-meta (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline will display characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">page-completions (On)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline uses an internal <span Class="emphasis">more</span>-like pager to display a screenful of possible completions at a time. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">print-completions-horizontally (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">revert-all-at-newline (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, readline will undo all changes to history lines  before returning when <span Class="bold">accept-line</span> is executed.  By default, history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across calls to <span Class="bold">readline</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)</span> This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If set to <span Class="manpage">On</span>words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">show-all-if-unmodified (Off)</span> This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to <span Class="bold">show-all-if-ambiguous</span>. If set to <span Class="manpage">On</span>words which have more than one possible completion without any possible partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">show-mode-in-prompt (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, add a character to the beginning of the prompt indicating the editing mode: emacs (@), vi command (:) or vi insertion (+). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">skip-completed-text (Off)</span> If set to <span Class="bold">On</span>, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line.  It's only active when performing completion in the middle of a word.  If enabled, readline does not insert characters from the completion that match characters after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result of tests.  There are four parser directives used. 
<p class="level0"><a name="fBiffP"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB$if\fP</span> 
<p class="level1">The  <span Class="bold">$if</span> construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using readline.  The text of the test extends to the end of the line; no characters are required to isolate it. 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level1"><a name="fBmodefP"></a><span class="nroffip">\fBmode\fP</span> 
<p class="level2">The <span Class="bold">mode=</span> form of the <span Class="bold">$if</span> directive is used to test whether readline is in emacs or vi mode. This may be used in conjunction with the <span Class="bold">set keymap</span> command, for instance, to set bindings in the <span Class="emphasis">emacs-standard</span> and <span Class="emphasis">emacs-ctlx</span> keymaps only if readline is starting out in emacs mode. 
<p class="level1"><a name="fBtermfP"></a><span class="nroffip">\fBterm\fP</span> 
<p class="level2">The <span Class="bold">term=</span> form may be used to include terminal-specific key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the <a class="bold" href="#">=</a> is tested against the both full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal name before the first <span Class="bold">-</span>.  This allows <span Class="emphasis">sun</span> to match both <span Class="emphasis">sun</span> and <span Class="emphasis">sun-cmd ,</span> for instance. 
<p class="level1"><a name="fBapplicationfP"></a><span class="nroffip">\fBapplication\fP</span> 
<p class="level2">The <span Class="bold">application</span> construct is used to include application-specific settings.  Each program using the readline library sets the <span Class="emphasis">application name</span>, and an initialization file can test for a particular value. This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in <span Class="bold">bash</span>: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level3"><pre class="level3">
<span class="bold">$if</span> Bash
&#35; Quote the current or previous word
"eC-xq": "eebe"eefe""
<span class="bold">$endif</span>
</pre>

<p class="level3">
<p class="level2">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name="fBendiffP"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB$endif\fP</span> 
<p class="level1">This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an <span Class="bold">$if</span> command. 
<p class="level0"><a name="fBelsefP"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB$else\fP</span> 
<p class="level1">Commands in this branch of the <span Class="bold">$if</span> directive are executed if the test fails. 
<p class="level0"><a name="fBincludefP"></a><span class="nroffip">\fB$include\fP</span> 
<p class="level1">This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands and bindings from that file.  For example, the following directive would read <span Class="emphasis">/etc/inputrc</span>: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level2"><pre class="level2">
<span class="bold">$include</span> ^ <span class="emphasis">/etc/inputrc</span>
</pre>

<p class="level2">
<p class="level1"><a name="Searching"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Searching</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Readline provides commands for searching through the command history (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a> below) for lines containing a specified string. There are two search modes: <span Class="emphasis">incremental</span> and <span Class="emphasis">non-incremental .</span> 
<p class="level0">Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the search string. As each character of the search string is typed, readline displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far. An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find the desired history entry. The characters present in the value of the <span Class="bold">isearch-terminators</span> variable are used to terminate an incremental search. If that variable has not been assigned a value the Escape and Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search. Control-G will abort an incremental search and restore the original line. When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes the current line. 
<p class="level0">To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S or Control-R as appropriate. This will search backward or forward in the history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far. Any other key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search and execute that command. For instance, a <span Class="emphasis">newline</span> will terminate the search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from the history list. 
<p class="level0">Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two Control-Rs are typed without any intervening characters defining a new search string, any remembered search string is used. 
<p class="level0">Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting to search for matching history lines.  The search string may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line. <a name="Readline"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Readline Command Names</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default key sequences to which they are bound. Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default. In the following descriptions, <span Class="emphasis">point</span> refers to the current cursor position, and <span Class="emphasis">mark</span> refers to a cursor position saved by the <span Class="bold">set-mark</span> command.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">accept-line (Newline, Return)</span> Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is non-empty, add it to the history list according to the state of the

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">yank-nth-arg (M-C-y)</span> Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the second word on the previous line) at point. With an argument <span Class="emphasis">n ,</span> insert the <span Class="emphasis">n</span>th word from the previous command (the words in the previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts the <span Class="emphasis">n</span>th word from the end of the previous command.

<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#"></a> yank-last-arg (M-.^, M-_^) Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last word of the previous history entry). With a numeric argument, behave exactly like <span Class="bold">yank-nth-arg</span>. Successive calls to <span Class="bold">yank-last-arg</span> move back through the history list, inserting the last word (or the word specified by the argument to the first call) of each line in turn. Any numeric argument supplied to these successive calls determines the direction to move through the history.  A negative argument switches the direction through the history (back or forward). The history expansion facilities are used to extract the last word, as if the "!$" history expansion had been specified. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">shell-expand-line (M-C-e)</span> Expand the line as the shell does.  This performs alias and history expansion as well as all of the shell word expansions.  See

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">transpose-chars (C-t)</span> Drag the character before point forward over the character at point, moving point forward as well. If point is at the end of the line, then this transposes the two characters before point. Negative arguments have no effect. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">transpose-words (M-t)</span> Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point over that word as well. If point is at the end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.    
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">upcase-word (M-u)</span> Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">overwrite-mode</span> Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric argument, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects only <span Class="bold">emacs</span> mode; <span Class="bold">vi</span> mode does overwrite differently. Each call to <span Class="emphasis">readline()</span> starts in insert mode. In overwrite mode, characters bound to <span Class="bold">self-insert</span> replace    the text at point rather than pushing the text to the right.

This is unbound by default, but usually bound to ESC-[. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">insert-comment (M-#)</span> Without a numeric argument, the value of the readline <span Class="bold">comment-begin</span> variable is inserted at the beginning of the current line. If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle:  if the characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value of <span Class="bold">comment-begin</span>, the value is inserted, otherwise the characters in <span Class="bold">comment-begin</span> are deleted from the beginning of  the line. In either case, the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed. The default value of <span Class="bold">comment-begin</span> causes this command to make the current line a shell comment. If a numeric argument causes the comment character to be removed, the line will be executed by the shell.

<p class="level0"><a name="Programmable"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Programmable Completion</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When word completion is attempted for an argument to a command for which a completion specification (a <span Class="emphasis">compspec</span>) has been defined using the <span Class="bold">complete</span> builtin (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below), the programmable completion facilities are invoked. 
<p class="level0">First, the command name is identified. If the command word is the empty string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), any compspec defined with the <span Class="bold">-E</span> option to <span Class="bold">complete</span> is used. If a compspec has been defined for that command, the compspec is used to generate the list of possible completions for the word. If the command word is a full pathname, a compspec for the full pathname is searched for first. If no compspec is found for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a compspec for the portion following the final slash. If those searches do not result in a compspec, any compspec defined with the <span Class="bold">-D</span> option to <span Class="bold">complete</span> is used as the default. 
<p class="level0">Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list of matching words. If a compspec is not found, the default <span Class="bold">bash</span> completion as described above under <a class="bold" href="#Completing">Completing</a> is performed. 
<p class="level0">First, the actions specified by the compspec are used. Only matches which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned. When the <span Class="bold">-f</span> or <span Class="bold">-d</span> option is used for filename or directory name completion, the shell variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FIGNORE</span> is used to filter the matches. 
<p class="level0">Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the <span Class="bold">-G</span> option are generated next. The words generated by the pattern need not match the word being completed. The 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">GLOBIGNORE</span> shell variable is not used to filter the matches, but the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FIGNORE</span> variable is used. 
<p class="level0">Next, the string specified as the argument to the <span Class="bold">-W</span> option is considered. The string is first split using the characters in the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> special variable as delimiters. Shell quoting is honored. Each word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, as described above under  
<p class="level0"><a class="manpage" href="#EXPANSION">EXPANSION .</a>The results are split using the rules described above under <a class="bold" href="#Word">Word Splitting</a>. The results of the expansion are prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the matching words become the possible completions. 
<p class="level0">After these matches have been generated, any shell function or command specified with the <span Class="bold">-F</span> and <span Class="bold">-C</span> options is invoked. When the command or function is invoked, the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">COMP_LINE</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">COMP_POINT</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">COMP_KEY</span>and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">COMP_TYPE</span> variables are assigned values as described above under <a class="bold" href="#Shell">Shell Variables</a>. If a shell function is being invoked, the  
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">COMP_WORDS</span> and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">COMP_CWORD</span> variables are also set. When the function or command is invoked, the first argument (<a class="bold" href="#1">$1</a>) is the name of the command whose arguments are being completed, the second argument (<a class="bold" href="#2">$2</a>) is the word being completed, and the third argument (<a class="bold" href="#3">$3</a>) is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command line. No filtering of the generated completions against the word being completed is performed; the function or command has complete freedom in generating the matches. 
<p class="level0">Any function specified with <span Class="bold">-F</span> is invoked first. The function may use any of the shell facilities, including the <span Class="bold">compgen</span> builtin described below, to generate the matches. It must put the possible completions in the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">COMPREPLY</span> array variable, one per array element. 
<p class="level0">Next, any command specified with the <span Class="bold">-C</span> option is invoked in an environment equivalent to command substitution. It should print a list of completions, one per line, to the standard output. Backslash may be used to escape a newline, if necessary. 
<p class="level0">After all of the possible completions are generated, any filter specified with the <span Class="bold">-X</span> option is applied to the list. The filter is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a <a class="bold" href="#">&</a> in the pattern is replaced with the text of the word being completed. A literal <a class="bold" href="#">&</a> may be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match. Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the list. A leading <a class="bold" href="#">!</a> negates the pattern; in this case any completion not matching the pattern will be removed. 
<p class="level0">Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the <span Class="bold">-P</span> and <span Class="bold">-S</span> options are added to each member of the completion list, and the result is returned to the readline completion code as the list of possible completions. 
<p class="level0">If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and the <span Class="bold">-o dirnames</span> option was supplied to <span Class="bold">complete</span> when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted. 
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="bold">-o plusdirs</span> option was supplied to <span Class="bold">complete</span> when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions. 
<p class="level0">By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to the completion code as the full set of possible completions. The default <span Class="bold">bash</span> completions are not attempted, and the readline default of filename completion is disabled. If the <span Class="bold">-o bashdefault</span> option was supplied to <span Class="bold">complete</span> when the compspec was defined, the <span Class="bold">bash</span> default completions are attempted if the compspec generates no matches. If the <span Class="bold">-o default</span> option was supplied to <span Class="bold">complete</span> when the compspec was defined, readline's default completion will be performed if the compspec (and, if attempted, the default <span Class="bold">bash</span> completions) generate no matches. 
<p class="level0">When a compspec indicates that directory name completion is desired, the programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash to completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to   the value of the <span Class="bold">mark-directories</span> readline variable, regardless of the setting of the <span Class="bold">mark-symlinked-directories</span> readline variable. 
<p class="level0">There is some support for dynamically modifying completions.  This is most useful when used in combination with a default completion specified with <span Class="bold">complete -D</span>. It's possible for shell functions executed as completion handlers to indicate that completion should be retried by returning an exit status of 124.  If a shell function returns 124, and changes the compspec associated with the command on which completion is being attempted (supplied as the first argument when the function is executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an attempt to find a new compspec for that command.  This allows a set of completions to be built dynamically as completion is attempted, rather than being loaded all at once. 
<p class="level0">For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each kept in a file corresponding to the name of the command, the following default completion function would load completions dynamically: 
<p class="level0">f(CW_completion_loader() <br>{ <br>	. "/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&1 && return 124 <br>} <br>complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default <br></span> <a name="HISTORY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">HISTORY</h2>
<p class="level0">When the <span Class="bold">-o history</span> option to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin is enabled, the shell provides access to the <span Class="emphasis">command history</span>, the list of commands previously typed. The value of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTSIZE</span> variable is used as the number of commands to save in a history list. The text of the last 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTSIZE</span> commands (default 500) is saved.  The shell stores each command in the history list prior to parameter and variable expansion (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#EXPANSION">EXPANSION</a> above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell variables 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTIGNORE</span> and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">HISTCONTROL .</span>
<p class="level0">On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTFILE</span> (default <span Class="emphasis">~/.bash_history</span>). The file named by the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTFILE</span> is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines specified by the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">HISTFILESIZE .</span>If <span Class="bold">HISTFILESIZE</span> is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history file is not truncated. When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the preceding history line. These timestamps are optionally displayed depending on the value of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTTIMEFORMAT</span> variable. When a shell with history enabled exits, the last 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">$HISTSIZE</span> lines are copied from the history list to 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">$HISTFILE .</span>If the <span Class="bold">histappend</span> shell option is enabled (see the description of <span Class="bold">shopt</span> under 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below), the lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the history file is overwritten. If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTFILE</span> is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved. If the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTTIMEFORMAT</span> variable is set, time stamps are written to the history file, marked with the history comment character, so they may be preserved across shell sessions. This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines. After saving the history, the history file is truncated to contain no more than 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTFILESIZE</span> lines.  If 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTFILESIZE</span> is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history file is not truncated. 
<p class="level0">The builtin command <span Class="bold">fc</span> (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below) may be used to list or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list. The <span Class="bold">history</span> builtin may be used to display or modify the history list and manipulate the history file. When using command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing mode that provide access to the history list. 
<p class="level0">The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history list.  The 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTCONTROL</span> and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HISTIGNORE</span> variables may be set to cause the shell to save only a subset of the commands entered. The <span Class="bold">cmdhist</span> shell option, if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line command in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to preserve syntactic correctness. The <span Class="bold">lithist</span> shell option causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons.  See the description of the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin below under 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> for information on setting and unsetting shell options. <a name="HISTORY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">HISTORY EXPANSION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the history expansion in <span Class="manpage">csh.</span>This section describes what syntax features are available.  This feature is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can be disabled using the <span Class="bold">+H</span> option to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command (see 
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS</a> below).  Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion by default. 
<p class="level0">History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous commands quickly. 
<p class="level0">History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read, before the shell breaks it into words. It takes place in two parts. The first is to determine which line from the history list to use during substitution. The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion into the current one. The line selected from the history is the <span Class="emphasis">event</span>, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are <span Class="emphasis">words</span>. Various <span Class="emphasis">modifiers</span> are available to manipulate the selected words. The line is broken into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several <span Class="emphasis">metacharacter</span>-separated words surrounded by quotes are considered one word. History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is ^<a class="bold" href="#">!</a>^ by default. Only backslash (^<span Class="bold">e</span>^) and single quotes can quote the history expansion character. 
<p class="level0">Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately following the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space, tab, newline, carriage return, and <a class="bold" href="#">=</a>. If the <span Class="bold">extglob</span> shell option is enabled, <a class="bold" href="#">(</a> will also inhibit expansion. 
<p class="level0">Several shell options settable with the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin may be used to tailor the behavior of history expansion. If the <span Class="bold">histverify</span> shell option is enabled (see the description of the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> builtin below), and <span Class="bold">readline</span> is being used, history substitutions are not immediately passed to the shell parser. Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into the <span Class="bold">readline</span> editing buffer for further modification. If <span Class="bold">readline</span> is being used, and the <span Class="bold">histreedit</span> shell option is enabled, a failed history substitution will be reloaded into the <span Class="bold">readline</span> editing buffer for correction. The <span Class="bold">-p</span> option to the <span Class="bold">history</span> builtin command may be used to see what a history expansion will do before using it. The <span Class="bold">-s</span> option to the <span Class="bold">history</span> builtin may be used to add commands to the end of the history list without actually executing them, so that they are available for subsequent recall. 
<p class="level0">The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history expansion mechanism (see the description of <span Class="bold">histchars</span> above under <a class="manpage" href="#Shell">Shell Variables ).</a>The shell uses the history comment character to mark history timestamps when writing the history file. <a name="Event"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Event Designators</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list. Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative to the current position in the history list.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">builtin</span> <span Class="emphasis">shell-builtin</span> [<span Class="emphasis">arguments</span>] Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it <span Class="emphasis">arguments ,</span> and return its exit status. This is useful when defining a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the functionality of the builtin within the function. The <span Class="bold">cd</span> builtin is commonly redefined this way. The return status is false if <span Class="emphasis">shell-builtin</span> is not a shell builtin command. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">caller</span> [<span Class="emphasis">expr</span>] Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function or a script executed with the <a class="bold" href="#">.</a> or <span Class="bold">source</span> builtins). Without <span Class="emphasis">expr</span>, <span Class="bold">caller</span> displays the line number and source filename of the current subroutine call. If a non-negative integer is supplied as <span Class="emphasis">expr</span>, <span Class="bold">caller</span>  displays the line number, subroutine name, and source file corresponding to that position in the current execution call stack.  This extra information may be used, for example, to print a stack trace.  The current frame is frame 0.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">cd</span> [<span Class="bold">-L</span>|[<span Class="bold">-P</span> [<span Class="bold">-e</span>]] [-@]] [<span Class="emphasis">dir</span>] Change the current directory to <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>. if <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> is not supplied, the value of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOME</span> shell variable is the default. Any additional arguments following <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> are ignored. The variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> defines the search path for the directory containing <span Class="emphasis">dir :</span> each directory name in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> is searched for <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>. Alternative directory names in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> are separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> is the same as the current directory, i.e., ``<a class="bold" href="#">.</a>''.  If <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> begins with a slash (/), then 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> is not used. The <span Class="bold">-P</span> option causes <span Class="bold">cd</span> to use the physical directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> and before processing instances of <a class="emphasis" href="#">..</a> in <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> (see also the <span Class="bold">-P</span> option to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command); the <span Class="bold">-L</span> option forces symbolic links to be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of <a class="emphasis" href="#">..</a> in <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>. If <a class="emphasis" href="#">..</a> appears in <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>, it is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname component from <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>, back to a slash or the beginning of <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>. If the <span Class="bold">-e</span> option is supplied with <span Class="manpage">-P</span>and the current working directory cannot be successfully determined after a successful directory change, <span Class="bold">cd</span> will return an unsuccessful status. On systems that support it, the <span Class="bold">-@</span> option presents the extended attributes associated with a file as a directory. An argument of <span Class="bold">-</span> is converted to 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">$OLDPWD</span> before the directory change is attempted. If a non-empty directory name from 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> is used, or if <span Class="bold">-</span> is the first argument, and the directory change is successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is written to the standard output. The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false otherwise.

Only builtin commands or commands found in the

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities. If either the <span Class="bold">-V</span> or <span Class="bold">-v</span> option is supplied, a description of <span Class="emphasis">command</span> is printed.  The <span Class="bold">-v</span> option causes a single word indicating the command or filename used to invoke <span Class="emphasis">command</span> to be displayed; the <span Class="bold">-V</span> option produces a more verbose description. If the <span Class="bold">-V</span> or <span Class="bold">-v</span> option is supplied, the exit status is 0 if <span Class="emphasis">command</span> was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied and an error occurred or <span Class="emphasis">command</span> cannot be found, the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit status of the <span Class="bold">command</span> builtin is the exit status of <span Class="emphasis">command .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">compgen</span> [<span Class="emphasis">option</span>] [<span Class="emphasis">word</span>] Generate possible completion matches for <span Class="emphasis">word</span> according to the <span Class="emphasis">option</span>s, which may be any option accepted by the <span Class="bold">complete</span> builtin with the exception of <span Class="bold">-p</span> and <span Class="bold">-r</span>, and write the matches to the standard output.

If the <span Class="bold">-p</span> option is supplied, or if no options are supplied, existing completion specifications are printed in a way that allows them to be reused as input. The <span Class="bold">-r</span> option removes a completion specification for each <span Class="emphasis">name</span>, or, if no <span Class="emphasis">name</span>s are supplied, all completion specifications. The <span Class="bold">-D</span> option indicates that the remaining options and actions should apply to the ``default'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a command for which no completion has previously been defined.

Disabling a builtin allows a disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even though the shell normally searches for builtins before disk commands. If <span Class="bold">-n</span> is used, each <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is disabled; otherwise, <span Class="emphasis">names</span> are enabled.

With no other option arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins. If <span Class="bold">-n</span> is supplied, only disabled builtins are printed. If <span Class="bold">-a</span> is supplied, the list printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is enabled. If <span Class="bold">-s</span> is supplied, the output is restricted to the POSIX <span Class="emphasis">special</span> builtins. The return value is 0 unless a <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">eval</span> [<span Class="emphasis">arg</span> ...] The <span Class="emphasis">arg</span>s are read and concatenated together into a single command.

No new process is created.  The <span Class="emphasis">arguments</span> become the arguments to <span Class="emphasis">command</span>. If the <span Class="bold">-l</span> option is supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth argument passed to  <span Class="emphasis">command .</span> This is what <span Class="emphasis">login (1)</span> does.  The <span Class="bold">-c</span> option causes <span Class="emphasis">command</span> to be executed with an empty environment.  If <span Class="bold">-a</span> is supplied, the shell passes <span Class="emphasis">name</span> as the zeroth argument to the executed command. If <span Class="emphasis">command</span> cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits, unless the <span Class="bold">execfail</span> shell option is enabled.  In that case, it returns failure. An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed. If <span Class="emphasis">command</span> is not specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">exit</span> [<span Class="emphasis">n</span>] Cause the shell to exit with a status of <span Class="emphasis">n</span>.  If <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed. A trap on

The <span Class="bold">-n</span> option causes the export property to be removed from each <span Class="emphasis">name</span>. If a variable name is followed by =<span Class="emphasis">word</span>, the value of the variable is set to <span Class="emphasis">word</span>. <span Class="bold">export</span> returns an exit status of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the <span Class="emphasis">names</span> is not a valid shell variable name, or <span Class="bold">-f</span> is supplied with a <span Class="emphasis">name</span> that is not a function.

<p class="level0">The first form selects a range of commands from <span Class="emphasis">first</span> to <span Class="emphasis">last</span> from the history list and displays or edits and re-executes them. <span Class="emphasis">First</span> and <span Class="emphasis">last</span> may be specified as a string (to locate the last command beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current command number).  If  <span Class="emphasis">last</span> is not specified it is set to the current command for listing (so that 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">prints the last 10 commands) and to <span Class="emphasis">first</span> otherwise. If <span Class="emphasis">first</span> is not specified it is set to the previous command for editing and -16 for listing. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-n</span> option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The <span Class="bold">-r</span> option reverses the order of the commands.  If the <span Class="bold">-l</span> option is given, the commands are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the editor given by <span Class="emphasis">ename</span> is invoked on a file containing those commands.  If <span Class="emphasis">ename</span> is not given, the value of the 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FCEDIT</span> variable is used, and the value of 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">EDITOR</span> if 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">FCEDIT</span> is not set.  If neither variable is set, 
<p class="level0">is used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed. 
<p class="level0">In the second form, <span Class="emphasis">command</span> is re-executed after each instance of <span Class="emphasis">pat</span> is replaced by <span Class="emphasis">rep</span>. <a class="emphasis" href="#Command">Command</a> is intepreted the same as <span Class="emphasis">first</span> above. A useful alias to use with this is 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">so that typing

<p class="level0">runs the last command beginning with 
<p class="level0">

<p class="level0">re-executes the last command. 
<p class="level0">If the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or <span Class="emphasis">first</span> or <span Class="emphasis">last</span> specify history lines out of range. If the <span Class="bold">-e</span> option is supplied, the return value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the second form is used, the return status is that of the command re-executed, unless <span Class="emphasis">cmd</span> does not specify a valid history line, in which case <span Class="bold">fc</span> returns failure. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">fg</span> [<span Class="emphasis">jobspec</span>] Resume <span Class="emphasis">jobspec</span> in the foreground, and make it the current job. If <span Class="emphasis">jobspec</span> is not present, the shell's notion of the <span Class="emphasis">current job</span> is used. The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground, or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if <span Class="emphasis">jobspec</span> does not specify a valid job or <span Class="emphasis">jobspec</span> specifies a job that was started without job control. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">getopts</span> <span Class="emphasis">optstring</span> <span Class="emphasis">name</span> [<span Class="emphasis">args</span>] <span Class="bold">getopts</span> is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters. <span Class="emphasis">optstring</span> contains the option characters to be recognized; if a character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space. The colon and question mark characters may not be used as option characters. Each time it is invoked, <span Class="bold">getopts</span> places the next option in the shell variable <span Class="emphasis">name ,</span> initializing <span Class="emphasis">name</span> if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">OPTIND .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTIND</span> is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an argument, <span Class="bold">getopts</span> places that argument into the variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">OPTARG .</span>The shell does not reset 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTIND</span> automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls to <span Class="bold">getopts</span> within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used. 
<p class="level0">When the end of options is encountered, <span Class="bold">getopts</span> exits with a return value greater than zero. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTIND</span> is set to the index of the first non-option argument, and <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is set to ?. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">getopts</span> normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are given in <span Class="emphasis">args ,</span> <span Class="bold">getopts</span> parses those instead. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">getopts</span> can report errors in two ways.  If the first character of <span Class="emphasis">optstring</span> is a colon, <span Class="emphasis">silent</span> error reporting is used.  In normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed when invalid options or missing option arguments are encountered. If the variable 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTERR</span> is set to 0, no error messages will be displayed, even if the first character of  <span Class="emphasis">optstring</span> is not a colon. 
<p class="level0">If an invalid option is seen, <span Class="bold">getopts</span> places ? into <span Class="emphasis">name</span> and, if not silent, prints an error message and unsets 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">OPTARG .</span>If <span Class="bold">getopts</span> is silent, the option character found is placed in 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTARG</span> and no diagnostic message is printed. 
<p class="level0">If a required argument is not found, and <span Class="bold">getopts</span> is not silent, a question mark (^<a class="bold" href="#">?</a>^) is placed in <span Class="emphasis">name ,</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTARG</span> is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed. If <span Class="bold">getopts</span> is silent, then a colon (^<a class="bold" href="#">:</a>^) is placed in <span Class="emphasis">name</span> and 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">OPTARG</span> is set to the option character found. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">getopts</span> returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found. It returns false if the end of options is encountered or an error occurs. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">hash</span> [<span Class="bold">-lr</span>] [<span Class="bold">-p</span> <span Class="emphasis">filename</span>] [<span Class="bold">-dt</span>] [<span Class="emphasis">name</span>] Each time <span Class="bold">hash</span> is invoked, the full pathname of the command  <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is determined by searching the directories in <span Class="bold">$PATH</span> and remembered.  Any previously-remembered pathname is discarded. If the <span Class="bold">-p</span> option is supplied, no path search is performed, and <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> is used as the full filename of the command. The <span Class="bold">-r</span> option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations. The <span Class="bold">-d</span> option causes the shell to forget the remembered location of each <span Class="emphasis">name</span>. If the <span Class="bold">-t</span> option is supplied, the full pathname to which each <span Class="emphasis">name</span> corresponds is printed.  If multiple <span Class="emphasis">name</span> arguments are supplied with <span Class="bold">-t</span>, the <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is printed before the hashed full pathname. The <span Class="bold">-l</span> option causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input. If no arguments are given, or if only <span Class="bold">-l</span> is supplied, information about remembered commands is printed. The return status is true unless a <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is not found or an invalid option is supplied. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">help</span> [<span Class="bold">-dms</span>] [<span Class="emphasis">pattern</span>] Display helpful information about builtin commands.  If <span Class="emphasis">pattern</span> is specified, <span Class="bold">help</span> gives detailed help on all commands matching <span Class="emphasis">pattern ;</span> otherwise help for all the builtins and shell control structures is printed.

The <span Class="bold">-v</span> option causes the output to be assigned to the variable <span Class="emphasis">var</span> rather than being printed to the standard output. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">format</span> is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply copied to standard output, character escape sequences, which are converted and copied to the standard output, and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive <span Class="emphasis">argument</span>. In addition to the standard <span Class="emphasis">printf</span>(1) format specifications, <span Class="bold">printf</span> interprets the following extensions: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">%b</span> causes <span Class="bold">printf</span> to expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding <span Class="emphasis">argument</span> (except that <span Class="bold">ec</span> terminates output, backslashes in <span Class="bold">e(aq</span>, <span Class="bold">e"</span>, and <span Class="bold">e?</span> are not removed, and octal escapes beginning with <span Class="bold">e0</span> may contain up to four digits). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">%q</span> causes <span Class="bold">printf</span> to output the corresponding <span Class="emphasis">argument</span> in a format that can be reused as shell input. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">%(datefmt)T</span> causes <span Class="bold">printf</span> to output the date-time string resulting from using <span Class="emphasis">datefmt</span> as a format string for <span Class="emphasis">strftime</span>(3). The corresponding <span Class="emphasis">argument</span> is an integer representing the number of seconds since the epoch. Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was invoked. If no argument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had been given. This is an exception to the usual <span Class="bold">printf</span> behavior. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as C constants, except that a leading plus or minus sign is allowed, and if the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the ASCII value of the following character.

<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">dir</span> Adds <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> to the directory stack at the top, making it the new current working directory as if it had been supplied as the argument to the <span Class="bold">cd</span> builtin. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">If the <span Class="bold">pushd</span> command is successful, a  <span Class="bold">dirs</span> is performed as well. If the first form is used, <span Class="bold">pushd</span> returns 0 unless the cd to <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> fails.  With the second form, <span Class="bold">pushd</span> returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty, a non-existent directory stack element is specified, or the directory change to the specified new current directory fails. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">pwd</span> [<span Class="bold">-LP</span>] Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory. The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the <span Class="bold">-P</span> option is supplied or the  <span Class="bold">-o physical</span> option to the <span Class="bold">set</span> builtin command is enabled. If the <span Class="bold">-L</span> option is used, the pathname printed may contain symbolic links. The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the name of the current directory or an invalid option is supplied.

The characters in  
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">IFS</span> are used to split the line into words using the same rules the shell uses for expansion (described above under <a class="bold" href="#Word">Word Splitting</a>). The backslash character (<span Class="bold">e</span>) may be used to remove any special meaning for the next character read and for line continuation. Options, if supplied, have the following meanings: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-a aname</span> The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable <span Class="emphasis">aname ,</span> starting at 0. <span Class="emphasis">aname</span> is unset before any new values are assigned. Other <span Class="emphasis">name</span> arguments are ignored. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-d delim</span> The first character of <span Class="emphasis">delim</span> is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-e</span> If the standard input is coming from a terminal, <span Class="bold">readline</span> (see 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#READLINE">READLINE</a> above) is used to obtain the line. Readline uses the current (or default, if line editing was not previously active) editing settings. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-i text</span> If <span Class="bold">readline</span> is being used to read the line, <span Class="emphasis">text</span> is placed into the editing buffer before editing begins. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-n nchars</span> <span Class="bold">read</span> returns after reading <span Class="emphasis">nchars</span> characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input, but honor a delimiter if fewer than <span Class="emphasis">nchars</span> characters are read before the delimiter. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-N nchars</span> <span Class="bold">read</span> returns after reading exactly <span Class="emphasis">nchars</span> characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input, unless EOF is encountered or <span Class="bold">read</span> times out. Delimiter characters encountered in the input are not treated specially and do not cause <span Class="bold">read</span> to return until <span Class="emphasis">nchars</span> characters are read. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-p prompt</span> Display <span Class="emphasis">prompt</span> on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any input.  The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-r</span> Backslash does not act as an escape character. The backslash is considered to be part of the line. In particular, a backslash-newline pair may not be used as a line continuation. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-s</span> Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-t timeout</span> Cause <span Class="bold">read</span> to time out and return failure if a complete line of input (or a specified number of characters) is not read within <span Class="emphasis">timeout</span> seconds. <span Class="emphasis">timeout</span> may be a decimal number with a fractional portion following the decimal point. This option is only effective if <span Class="bold">read</span> is reading input from a terminal, pipe, or other special file; it has no effect when reading from regular files. If <span Class="bold">read</span> times out, <span Class="bold">read</span> saves any partial input read into the specified variable <span Class="emphasis">name</span>. If <span Class="emphasis">timeout</span> is 0, <span Class="bold">read</span> returns immediately, without trying to read any data.  The exit status is 0 if input is available on the specified file descriptor, non-zero otherwise. The exit status is greater than 128 if the timeout is exceeded. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-u fd</span> Read input from file descriptor <span Class="emphasis">fd</span>.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">readonly</span> [<span Class="bold">-aAf</span>] [<span Class="bold">-p</span>] [<span Class="emphasis">name</span>[=<span Class="emphasis">word</span>] ...] 
<p class="level0">The given <span Class="emphasis">names</span> are marked readonly; the values of these <span Class="emphasis">names</span> may not be changed by subsequent assignment. If the <span Class="bold">-f</span> option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the <span Class="emphasis">names</span> are so marked. The <span Class="bold">-a</span> option restricts the variables to indexed arrays; the <span Class="bold">-A</span> option restricts the variables to associative arrays. If both options are supplied, <span Class="bold">-A</span> takes precedence. If no <span Class="emphasis">name</span> arguments are given, or if the <span Class="bold">-p</span> option is supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed. The other options may be used to restrict the output to a subset of the set of readonly names. The <span Class="bold">-p</span> option causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input. If a variable name is followed by =<span Class="emphasis">word</span>, the value of the variable is set to <span Class="emphasis">word</span>. The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the <span Class="emphasis">names</span> is not a valid shell variable name, or <span Class="bold">-f</span> is supplied with a <span Class="emphasis">name</span> that is not a function. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">return</span> [<span Class="emphasis">n</span>] Causes a function to stop executing and return the value specified by <span Class="emphasis">n</span> to its caller. If  <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed in the function body.  If <span Class="bold">return</span> is used outside a function, but during execution of a script by the  <a class="bold" href="#">.</a> (<span Class="bold">source</span>) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return either <span Class="emphasis">n</span> or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script. If <span Class="emphasis">n</span> is supplied, the return value is its least significant 8 bits. The return status is non-zero if <span Class="bold">return</span> is supplied a non-numeric argument, or is used outside a function and not during execution of a script by <a class="bold" href="#">.</a>^ or <span Class="bold">source</span>. Any command associated with the <span Class="bold">RETURN</span> trap is executed before execution resumes after the function or script.

If a compound command or shell function sets <span Class="bold">-e</span> while executing in a context where <span Class="bold">-e</span> is ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command containing the function call completes.

Unless otherwise noted, the <span Class="bold">shopt</span> options are disabled (unset) by default. 
<p class="level1">The return status when listing options is zero if all <span Class="emphasis">optnames</span> are enabled, non-zero otherwise.  When setting or unsetting options, the return status is zero unless an <span Class="emphasis">optname</span> is not a valid shell option. 
<p class="level1">The list of <span Class="bold">shopt</span> options is: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">autocd</span> If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were the argument to the <span Class="bold">cd</span> command. This option is only used by interactive shells. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">cdable_vars</span> If set, an argument to the <span Class="bold">cd</span> builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">cdspell</span> If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a <span Class="bold">cd</span> command will be corrected. The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing character, and one character too many. If a correction is found, the corrected filename is printed, and the command proceeds. This option is only used by interactive shells. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">checkhash</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> checks that a command found in the hash table exists before trying to execute it.  If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">checkjobs</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting an interactive shell.  If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a second exit is attempted without an intervening command (see 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#JOB">JOB CONTROL</a> above).  The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">checkwinsize</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> checks the window size after each command and, if necessary, updates the values of 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">LINES</span> and 
<p class="level1"><span Class="manpage">COLUMNS .</span>
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">cmdhist</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history entry.  This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">compat31</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> changes its behavior to that of version 3.1 with respect to quoted arguments to the <a class="bold" href="#">[[</a> conditional command's <a class="bold" href="#">=~</a> operator and locale-specific string comparison when using the <a class="bold" href="#">[[</a> conditional command's <span Class="bold">&lt;</span> and <span Class="bold">&gt;</span> operators. Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation and <span Class="emphasis">strcmp (3);</span> bash-4.1 and later use the current locale's collation sequence and <span Class="emphasis">strcoll (3).</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">compat32</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> changes its behavior to that of version 3.2 with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using the <a class="bold" href="#">[[</a> conditional command's <span Class="bold">&lt;</span> and <span Class="bold">&gt;</span> operators (see previous item). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">compat40</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> changes its behavior to that of version 4.0 with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using the <a class="bold" href="#">[[</a> conditional command's <span Class="bold">&lt;</span> and <span Class="bold">&gt;</span> operators (see description of <span Class="bold">compat31</span>) and the effect of interrupting a command list. Bash versions 4.0 and later interrupt the list as if the shell received the interrupt; previous versions continue with the next command in the list. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">compat41</span> If set, <span Class="manpage">bash</span>when in <span Class="emphasis">posix</span> mode, treats a single quote in a double-quoted parameter expansion as a special character.  The single quotes must match (an even number) and the characters between the single quotes are considered quoted.  This is the behavior of posix mode through version 4.1. The default bash behavior remains as in previous versions. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">compat42</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> does not process the replacement string in the pattern substitution word expansion using quote removal. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">complete_fullquote</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names when performing completion. If not set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> removes metacharacters such as the dollar sign from the set of characters that will be quoted in completed filenames when these metacharacters appear in shell variable references in words to be completed. This means that dollar signs in variable names that expand to directories will not be quoted; however, any dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be quoted, either. This is active only when bash is using backslashes to quote completed filenames. This variable is set by default, which is the default bash behavior in versions through 4.2. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">direxpand</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> replaces directory names with the results of word expansion when performing filename completion.  This changes the contents of the readline editing buffer. If not set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> attempts to preserve what the user typed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">dirspell</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> attempts spelling correction on directory names during word completion if the directory name initially supplied does not exist. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">dotglob</span> If set,  <span Class="bold">bash</span> includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of pathname expansion. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">execfail</span> If set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified as an argument to the <span Class="bold">exec</span> builtin command.  An interactive shell does not exit if <span Class="bold">exec</span> fails. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">expand_aliases</span> If set, aliases are expanded as described above under 
<p class="level1"><a class="manpage" href="#ALIASES">ALIASES .</a>This option is enabled by default for interactive shells. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">extdebug</span> If set, behavior intended for use by debuggers is enabled: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2"><a class="bold" href="#1">1.</a> The <span Class="bold">-F</span> option to the <span Class="bold">declare</span> builtin displays the source file name and line number corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">extglob</span> If set, the extended pattern matching features described above under <a class="bold" href="#Pathname">Pathname Expansion</a> are enabled.

This option is enabled by default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">failglob</span> If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during pathname expansion result in an expansion error. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">force_fignore</span> If set, the suffixes specified by the 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">FIGNORE</span> shell variable cause words to be ignored when performing word completion even if the ignored words are the only possible completions. See 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#SHELL">SHELL VARIABLES</a> above for a description of 
<p class="level1"><span Class="manpage">FIGNORE .</span>This option is enabled by default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">globasciiranges</span> If set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket expressions (see 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">Pattern Matching</span> above) behave as if in the traditional C locale when performing comparisons.  That is, the current locale's collating sequence is not taken into account, so <span Class="bold">b</span> will not collate between <span Class="bold">A</span> and <span Class="manpage">B</span>and upper-case and lower-case ASCII characters will collate together. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">globstar</span> If set, the pattern <a class="bold" href="#">**</a> used in a pathname expansion context will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories. If the pattern is followed by a <a class="bold" href="#">/</a>, only directories and subdirectories match. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">gnu_errfmt</span> If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">histappend</span> If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">HISTFILE</span> variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">histreedit</span> If set, and <span Class="bold">readline</span> is being used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">histverify</span> If set, and  <span Class="bold">readline</span> is being used, the results of history substitution are not immediately passed to the shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the <span Class="bold">readline</span> editing buffer, allowing further modification. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">hostcomplete</span> If set, and <span Class="bold">readline</span> is being used, <span Class="bold">bash</span> will attempt to perform hostname completion when a word containing a <a class="bold" href="#">@</a> is being completed (see <a class="bold" href="#Completing">Completing</a> under 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#READLINE">READLINE</a> above). This is enabled by default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">huponexit</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> will send 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">SIGHUP</span> to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">interactive_comments</span> If set, allow a word beginning with <a class="bold" href="#">#</a> to cause that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored in an interactive shell (see 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#COMMENTS">COMMENTS</a> above).  This option is enabled by default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">lastpipe</span> If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline not executed in the background in the current shell environment. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">lithist</span> If set, and the <span Class="bold">cmdhist</span> option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">login_shell</span> The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#INVOCATION">INVOCATION</a> above). The value may not be changed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">mailwarn</span> If set, and a file that <span Class="bold">bash</span> is checking for mail has been   accessed since the last time it was checked, the message ``The mail in <span Class="emphasis">mailfile</span> has been read'' is displayed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">no_empty_cmd_completion</span> If set, and <span Class="bold">readline</span> is being used, <span Class="bold">bash</span> will not attempt to search the 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> for possible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">nocaseglob</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname expansion (see <a class="bold" href="#Pathname">Pathname Expansion</a> above). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">nocasematch</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing matching while executing <span Class="bold">case</span> or <a class="bold" href="#">[[</a> conditional commands. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">nullglob</span> If set, <span Class="bold">bash</span> allows patterns which match no files (see <a class="bold" href="#Pathname">Pathname Expansion</a> above) to expand to a null string, rather than themselves. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">progcomp</span> If set, the programmable completion facilities (see <a class="bold" href="#Programmable">Programmable Completion</a> above) are enabled. This option is enabled by default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">promptvars</span> If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as described in 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#PROMPTING">PROMPTING</a> above.  This option is enabled by default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">restricted_shell</span> The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode (see 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#RESTRICTED">RESTRICTED SHELL</a> below). The value may not be changed. This is not reset when the startup files are executed, allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">shift_verbose</span> If set, the <span Class="bold">shift</span> builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">sourcepath</span> If set, the <span Class="bold">source</span> (<a class="bold" href="#">.</a>) builtin uses the value of 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> to find the directory containing the file supplied as an argument. This option is enabled by default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">xpg_echo</span> If set, the <span Class="bold">echo</span> builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.
