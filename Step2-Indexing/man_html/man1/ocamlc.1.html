<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The OCaml bytecode compiler <span Class="manpage">ocamlc (1)</span>compiles OCaml source files to bytecode object files and links these object files to produce standalone bytecode executable files. These executable files are then run by the bytecode interpreter <span Class="manpage">ocamlrun (1).</span>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="manpage">ocamlc (1)</span>command has a command-line interface similar to the one of most C compilers. It accepts several types of arguments and processes them sequentially: 
<p class="level0">Arguments ending in .mli are taken to be source files for compilation unit interfaces. Interfaces specify the names exported by compilation units: they declare value names with their types, define public data types, declare abstract data types, and so on. From the file <span Class="emphasis">x \&.mli,</span> the <span Class="manpage">ocamlc (1)</span>compiler produces a compiled interface in the file <span Class="emphasis">x \&.cmi.</span> 
<p class="level0">Arguments ending in .ml are taken to be source files for compilation unit implementations. Implementations provide definitions for the names exported by the unit, and also contain expressions to be evaluated for their side-effects.  From the file <span Class="emphasis">x \&.ml,</span> the <span Class="manpage">ocamlc (1)</span>compiler produces compiled object bytecode in the file <span Class="emphasis">x \&.cmo.</span> 
<p class="level0">If the interface file <span Class="emphasis">x \&.mli</span> exists, the implementation <span Class="emphasis">x \&.ml</span> is checked against the corresponding compiled interface <span Class="emphasis">x \&.cmi,</span> which is assumed to exist. If no interface <span Class="emphasis">x \&.mli</span> is provided, the compilation of <span Class="emphasis">x \&.ml</span> produces a compiled interface file <span Class="emphasis">x \&.cmi</span> in addition to the compiled object code file <span Class="emphasis">x \&.cmo.</span> The file <span Class="emphasis">x \&.cmi</span> produced corresponds to an interface that exports everything that is defined in the implementation <span Class="emphasis">x \&.ml.</span> 
<p class="level0">Arguments ending in .cmo are taken to be compiled object bytecode.  These files are linked together, along with the object files obtained by compiling .ml arguments (if any), and the OCaml standard library, to produce a standalone executable program. The order in which .cmo and.ml arguments are presented on the command line is relevant: compilation units are initialized in that order at run-time, and it is a link-time error to use a component of a unit before having initialized it. Hence, a given <span Class="emphasis">x \&.cmo</span> file must come before all .cmo files that refer to the unit <span Class="emphasis">x .</span> 
<p class="level0">Arguments ending in .cma are taken to be libraries of object bytecode. A library of object bytecode packs in a single file a set of object bytecode files (.cmo files). Libraries are built with <span Class="bold">ocamlc\ -a</span> (see the description of the <span Class="bold">-a</span> option below). The object files contained in the library are linked as regular .cmo files (see above), in the order specified when the .cma file was built. The only difference is that if an object file contained in a library is not referenced anywhere in the program, then it is not linked in. 
<p class="level0">Arguments ending in .c are passed to the C compiler, which generates a .o object file. This object file is linked with the program if the <span Class="bold">-custom</span> flag is set (see the description of <span Class="bold">-custom</span> below). 
<p class="level0">Arguments ending in .o or .a are assumed to be C object files and libraries. They are passed to the C linker when linking in <span Class="bold">-custom</span> mode (see the description of <span Class="bold">-custom</span> below). 
<p class="level0">Arguments ending in .so are assumed to be C shared libraries (DLLs).  During linking, they are searched for external C functions referenced from the OCaml code, and their names are written in the generated bytecode executable. The run-time system <span Class="manpage">ocamlrun (1)</span>then loads them dynamically at program start-up time. 
<p class="level0">The output of the linking phase is a file containing compiled bytecode that can be executed by the OCaml bytecode interpreter: the command <span Class="manpage">ocamlrun (1).</span>If <span Class="bold">caml.out</span> is the name of the file produced by the linking phase, the command <span Class="bold">ocamlrun caml.out</span> <span Class="emphasis">arg1 \  \ arg2 \ ... \ argn</span> executes the compiled code contained in <span Class="manpage">caml.out</span>passing it as arguments the character strings <span Class="emphasis">arg1</span> to <span Class="emphasis">argn .</span> (See <span Class="manpage">ocamlrun (1)</span>for more details.) 
<p class="level0">On most systems, the file produced by the linking phase can be run directly, as in: <span Class="bold">./caml.out</span> <span Class="emphasis">arg1 \  \ arg2 \ ... \ argn .</span> The produced file has the executable bit set, and it manages to launch the bytecode interpreter by itself. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ocamlc.opt</span> is the same compiler as <span Class="manpage">ocamlc</span>but compiled with the native-code compiler <span Class="manpage">ocamlopt (1).</span>Thus, it behaves exactly like <span Class="manpage">ocamlc</span>but compiles faster. <span Class="bold">ocamlc.opt</span> may not be available in all installations of OCaml. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The following command-line options are recognized by <span Class="manpage">ocamlc (1).</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-a</span> Build a library (.cma file) with the object files (.cmo files) given on the command line, instead of linking them into an executable file. The name of the library must be set with the <span Class="bold">-o</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If <span Class="manpage">-custom</span>, <a class="manpage" href="#">\ -cclib \ or \ -ccopt</a>options are passed on the command line, these options are stored in the resulting .cma library.  Then, linking with this library automatically adds back the <span Class="manpage">-custom</span>, <a class="manpage" href="#">\ -cclib \ and \ -ccopt</a>options as if they had been provided on the command line, unless the <span Class="bold">-noautolink</span> option is given. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-absname</span> Show absolute filenames in error messages. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-annot</span> Dump detailed information about the compilation (types, bindings, tail-calls, etc).  The information for file <span Class="emphasis">src .ml</span> is put into file <span Class="emphasis">src .annot.</span> In case of a type error, dump all the information inferred by the type-checker before the error. The <span Class="emphasis">src .annot</span> file can be used with the emacs commands given in <span Class="bold">emacs/caml-types.el</span> to display types and other annotations interactively. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-bin-annot</span> Dump detailed information about the compilation (types, bindings, tail-calls, etc) in binary format. The information for file <span Class="emphasis">src .ml</span> is put into file <span Class="emphasis">src .cmt.</span> In case of a type error, dump all the information inferred by the type-checker before the error. The annotation files produced by <span Class="bold">-bin-annot</span> contain more information and are much more compact than the files produced by <span Class="manpage">-annot .</span>
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-c</span> Compile only. Suppress the linking phase of the compilation. Source code files are turned into compiled files, but no executable file is produced. This option is useful to compile modules separately. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cc \ ccomp</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">ccomp</span> as the C linker when linking in "custom runtime" mode (see the <span Class="bold">-custom</span> option) and as the C compiler for compiling .c source files. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cclib\ -l libname</span> Pass the <span Class="bold">-l libname</span> option to the C linker when linking in "custom runtime" mode (see the <span Class="bold">-custom</span> option). This causes the given C library to be linked with the program. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ccopt \ option</span> Pass the given <span Class="emphasis">option</span> to the C compiler and linker, when linking in "custom runtime" mode (see the <span Class="bold">-custom</span> option). For instance, <span Class="bold">-ccopt\ -L dir</span> causes the C linker to search for C libraries in directory <span Class="emphasis">dir .</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-compat-32</span> Check that the generated bytecode executable can run on 32-bit platforms and signal an error if it cannot. This is useful when compiling bytecode on a 64-bit machine. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-config</span> Print the version number of <span Class="manpage">ocamlc (1)</span>and a detailed summary of its configuration, then exit. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-custom</span> Link in "custom runtime" mode. In the default linking mode, the linker produces bytecode that is intended to be executed with the shared runtime system, <span Class="manpage">ocamlrun (1).</span>In the custom runtime mode, the linker produces an output file that contains both the runtime system and the bytecode for the program. The resulting file is larger, but it can be executed directly, even if the <span Class="manpage">ocamlrun (1)</span>command is not installed. Moreover, the "custom runtime" mode enables linking OCaml code with user-defined C functions. 
<p class="level1">Never use the <span Class="manpage">strip (1)</span>command on executables produced by <span Class="manpage">ocamlc\ -custom</span>this would remove the bytecode part of the executable. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-dllib\ -l libname</span> Arrange for the C shared library <span Class="bold">dll libname .so</span> to be loaded dynamically by the run-time system , <span Class="manpage">ocamlrun (1)</span>at program start-up time. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-dllpath \ dir</span> Adds the directory <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> to the run-time search path for shared C libraries.  At link-time, shared libraries are searched in the standard search path (the one corresponding to the <span Class="bold">-I</span> option). The <span Class="bold">-dllpath</span> option simply stores <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> in the produced executable file, where <span Class="manpage">ocamlrun (1)</span>can find it and use it. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-for-pack \ ident</span> This option is accepted for compatibility with <span Class="manpage">ocamlopt (1)</span>; it does nothing. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-g</span> Add debugging information while compiling and linking. This option is required in order to be able to debug the program with <span Class="manpage">ocamldebug (1)</span>and to produce stack backtraces when the program terminates on an uncaught exception. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-i</span> Cause the compiler to print all defined names (with their inferred types or their definitions) when compiling an implementation (.ml file). No compiled files (.cmo and .cmi files) are produced. This can be useful to check the types inferred by the compiler. Also, since the output follows the syntax of interfaces, it can help in writing an explicit interface (.mli file) for a file: just redirect the standard output of the compiler to a .mli file, and edit that file to remove all declarations of unexported names. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-I \ directory</span> Add the given directory to the list of directories searched for compiled interface files (.cmi), compiled object code files (.cmo), libraries (.cma), and C libraries specified with <span Class="bold">-cclib\ -l</span> <span Class="emphasis">xxx .</span> By default, the current directory is searched first, then the standard library directory. Directories added with <span Class="bold">-I</span> are searched after the current directory, in the order in which they were given on the command line, but before the standard library directory. 
<p class="level1">If the given directory starts with <a class="manpage" href="#">+</a>it is taken relative to the standard library directory. For instance, <span Class="bold">-I\ +labltk</span> adds the subdirectory <span Class="bold">labltk</span> of the standard library to the search path. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-impl \ filename</span> Compile the file <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> as an implementation file, even if its extension is not .ml. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-intf \ filename</span> Compile the file <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> as an interface file, even if its extension is not .mli. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-intf-suffix \ string</span> Recognize file names ending with <span Class="emphasis">string</span> as interface files (instead of the default .mli). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-labels</span> Labels are not ignored in types, labels may be used in applications, and labelled parameters can be given in any order.  This is the default. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-linkall</span> Force all modules contained in libraries to be linked in. If this flag is not given, unreferenced modules are not linked in. When building a library (option <span Class="manpage">-a )</span>setting the <span Class="bold">-linkall</span> option forces all subsequent links of programs involving that library to link all the modules contained in the library. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-make-runtime</span> Build a custom runtime system (in the file specified by option <span Class="manpage">-o )</span>incorporating the C object files and libraries given on the command line.  This custom runtime system can be used later to execute bytecode executables produced with the option <span Class="bold">ocamlc\ -use-runtime</span> <span Class="emphasis">runtime-name .</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-no-app-funct</span> Deactivates the applicative behaviour of functors. With this option, each functor application generates new types in its result and applying the same functor twice to the same argument yields two incompatible structures. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-noassert</span> Do not compile assertion checks.  Note that the special form <span Class="bold">assert\ false</span> is always compiled because it is typed specially. This flag has no effect when linking already-compiled files. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-noautolink</span> When linking .cma libraries, ignore <span Class="manpage">-custom</span>, <a class="manpage" href="#">\ -cclib \ and \ -ccopt</a>options potentially contained in the libraries (if these options were given when building the libraries).  This can be useful if a library contains incorrect specifications of C libraries or C options; in this case, during linking, set <span Class="bold">-noautolink</span> and pass the correct C libraries and options on the command line. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-nolabels</span> Ignore non-optional labels in types. Labels cannot be used in applications, and parameter order becomes strict. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-nostdlib</span> Do not include the standard library directory in the list of directories searched for compiled interfaces (see option <span Class="bold">-I</span> ). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-o \ exec-file</span> Specify the name of the output file produced by the linker. The default output name is , <span Class="manpage">a.out</span>in keeping with the Unix tradition. If the <span Class="bold">-a</span> option is given, specify the name of the library produced.  If the <span Class="bold">-pack</span> option is given, specify the name of the packed object file produced.  If the <span Class="bold">-output-obj</span> option is given, specify the name of the output file produced. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-output-obj</span> Cause the linker to produce a C object file instead of a bytecode executable file. This is useful to wrap OCaml code as a C library, callable from any C program. The name of the output object file must be set with the <span Class="bold">-o</span> option. This option can also be used to produce a C source file (.c extension) or a compiled shared/dynamic library (.so extension). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-pack</span> Build a bytecode object file (.cmo file) and its associated compiled interface (.cmi) that combines the object files given on the command line, making them appear as sub-modules of the output .cmo file.  The name of the output .cmo file must be given with the <span Class="bold">-o</span> option.  For instance, <span Class="bold">ocamlc\ -pack\ -o\ p.cmo\ a.cmo\ b.cmo\ c.cmo</span> generates compiled files p.cmo and p.cmi describing a compilation unit having three sub-modules A, B and C, corresponding to the contents of the object files a.cmo, b.cmo and c.cmo.  These contents can be referenced as P.A, P.B and P.C in the remainder of the program. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-pp \ command</span> Cause the compiler to call the given <span Class="emphasis">command</span> as a preprocessor for each source file. The output of <span Class="emphasis">command</span> is redirected to an intermediate file, which is compiled. If there are no compilation errors, the intermediate file is deleted afterwards. The name of this file is built from the basename of the source file with the extension .ppi for an interface (.mli) file and .ppo for an implementation (.ml) file. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ppx \ command</span> After parsing, pipe the abstract syntax tree through the preprocessor <span Class="emphasis">command .</span> The format of the input and output of the preprocessor are not yet documented. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-principal</span> Check information path during type-checking, to make sure that all types are derived in a principal way.  When using labelled arguments and/or polymorphic methods, this flag is required to ensure future versions of the compiler will be able to infer types correctly, even if internal algorithms change. All programs accepted in <span Class="bold">-principal</span> mode are also accepted in the default mode with equivalent types, but different binary signatures, and this may slow down type checking; yet it is a good idea to use it once before publishing source code. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-rectypes</span> Allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking.  By default, only recursive types where the recursion goes through an object type are supported. Note that once you have created an interface using this flag, you must use it again for all dependencies. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-runtime-variant \ suffix</span> Add <span Class="emphasis">suffix</span> to the name of the runtime library that will be used by the program. If OCaml was configured with option <span Class="manpage">-with-debug-runtime</span>then the <span Class="bold">d</span> suffix is supported and gives a debug version of the runtime. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-short-paths</span> When a type is visible under several module-paths, use the shortest one when printing the type's name in inferred interfaces and error and warning messages. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-strict-sequence</span> Force the left-hand part of each sequence to have type unit. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-thread</span> Compile or link multithreaded programs, in combination with the system "threads" library described in <span Class="emphasis">The\ OCaml\ user's\ manual .</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-unsafe</span> Turn bound checking off for array and string accesses (the <span Class="manpage">v.(i) and s.[i]</span>constructs). Programs compiled with <span Class="bold">-unsafe</span> are therefore slightly faster, but unsafe: anything can happen if the program accesses an array or string outside of its bounds. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-use-runtime \ runtime-name</span> Generate a bytecode executable file that can be executed on the custom runtime system <span Class="emphasis">runtime-name ,</span> built earlier with <span Class="bold">ocamlc\ -make-runtime</span> <span Class="emphasis">runtime-name .</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Print the version number of the compiler and the location of the standard library directory, then exit. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-verbose</span> Print all external commands before they are executed, in particular invocations of the C compiler and linker in <span Class="bold">-custom</span> mode.  Useful to debug C library problems. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-vmthread</span> Compile or link multithreaded programs, in combination with the VM-level threads library described in <span Class="emphasis">The\ OCaml\ user's\ manual .</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="manpage">-vnum \ or\  -version</span>Print the version number of the compiler in short form (e.g. "3.11.0"), then exit. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-w \ warning-list</span> Enable, disable, or mark as fatal the warnings specified by the argument <span Class="emphasis">warning-list .</span> 
<p class="level1">Each warning can be <span Class="emphasis">enabled \ or\  disabled ,</span> and each warning can be <span Class="emphasis">fatal or</span> <span Class="emphasis">non-fatal .</span> If a warning is disabled, it isn't displayed and doesn't affect compilation in any way (even if it is fatal).  If a warning is enabled, it is displayed normally by the compiler whenever the source code triggers it.  If it is enabled and fatal, the compiler will also stop with an error after displaying it. 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="emphasis">warning-list</span> argument is a sequence of warning specifiers, with no separators between them.  A warning specifier is one of the following: 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">+ num</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable warning number <span Class="emphasis">num .</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">- num</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Disable warning number <span Class="emphasis">num .</span> 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">@ num</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable and mark as fatal warning number <span Class="emphasis">num .</span> 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">+ num1 .. num2</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable all warnings between <span Class="emphasis">num1</span> and <span Class="emphasis">num2</span> (inclusive). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">- num1 .. num2</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Disable all warnings between <span Class="emphasis">num1</span> and <span Class="emphasis">num2</span> (inclusive). 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">@ num1 .. num2</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable and mark as fatal all warnings between <span Class="emphasis">num1</span> and <span Class="emphasis">num2</span> (inclusive). 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">+ letter</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable the set of warnings corresponding to <span Class="emphasis">letter .</span> The letter may be uppercase or lowercase. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">- letter</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Disable the set of warnings corresponding to <span Class="emphasis">letter .</span> The letter may be uppercase or lowercase. 
<p class="level1"><a class="bold" href="#">@ letter</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable and mark as fatal the set of warnings corresponding to <span Class="emphasis">letter .</span> The letter may be uppercase or lowercase. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">uppercase-letter</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Enable the set of warnings corresponding to <span Class="emphasis">uppercase-letter .</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">lowercase-letter</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;Disable the set of warnings corresponding to <span Class="emphasis">lowercase-letter .</span> 
<p class="level1">The warning numbers are as follows.

The <span Class="emphasis">warning-list</span> has the same meaning as for the <span Class="bold">-w</span> option: a <a class="bold" href="#">+</a> sign (or an uppercase letter) marks the corresponding warnings as fatal, a <span Class="bold">-</span> sign (or a lowercase letter) turns them back into non-fatal warnings, and a <a class="bold" href="#">@</a> sign both enables and marks as fatal the corresponding warnings. 
<p class="level1">Note: it is not recommended to use the <span Class="bold">-warn-error</span> option in production code, because it will almost certainly prevent compiling your program with later versions of OCaml when they add new warnings.
