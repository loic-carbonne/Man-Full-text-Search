<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">Run the e-*(TX typesetter on <span Class="emphasis">file ,</span> by default creating <span Class="emphasis">file.dvi .</span> If the file argument has no extension, ".tex" will be appended to it.  Instead of a filename, a set of e-*(TX commands can be given, the first of which must start with a backslash. With a  <span Class="bold">& format</span> argument e-*(TX uses a different set of precompiled commands, contained in <span Class="emphasis">format\fB.fmt\fP ;</span> it is usually better to use the <span Class="bold">-fmt</span> <span Class="emphasis">format</span> option instead. 
<p class="level0">e-*(TX is the first concrete result of an international research & development project, the NTS Project, which was established under the aegis of DANTE e.V. during 1992. The aims of the project are to perpetuate and develop the spirit and philosophy of *(TX, whilst respecting Knuth's wish that *(TX should remain frozen. 
<p class="level0">e-*(TX can be used in two different modes: in <span Class="emphasis">compatibility mode</span> it is supposed to be completely interchangable with standard *(TX. In <span Class="emphasis">extended mode</span> several new primitives are added that facilitate (among other things) bidirectional typesetting. 
<p class="level0">An extended mode format is generated by prefixing the name of the source file for the format with an asterisk (*). 
<p class="level0">e-*(TX's handling of its command-line arguments is similar to that of the other *(TX programs in the <span Class="emphasis">web2c</span> implementation. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">This version of e-*(TX understands the following command line options. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-fmt \ format</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">format</span> as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which e-*(TX was called or a <span Class="emphasis">%&</span> line. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-enc</span> Enable the enc*(TX extensions.  This option is only effective in combination with <span Class="manpage">-ini .</span>For documentation of the enc*(TX extensions see <span Class="manpage">http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-etex</span> Enable the e-*(TX extensions.  This option is only effective in combination with <span Class="manpage">-ini .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-file-line-error</span> Print error messages in the form <span Class="emphasis">file:line:error</span> which is similar to the way many compilers format them. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-file-line-error</span> Disable printing error messages in the <span Class="emphasis">file:line:error</span> style. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-file-line-error-style</span> This is the old name of the <span Class="bold">-file-line-error</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-halt-on-error</span> Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during processing. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-help</span> Print help message and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ini</span> Start in <span Class="emphasis">INI</span> mode, which is used to dump formats.  The <span Class="emphasis">INI</span> mode can be used for typesetting, but no format is preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes may be required. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-interaction \ mode</span> Sets the interaction mode.  The mode can be either <span Class="emphasis">batchmode ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">nonstopmode ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">scrollmode ,</span> and <span Class="emphasis">errorstopmode .</span> The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding ecommands. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ipc</span> Send DVI output to a socket as well as the usual output file.  Whether this option is available is the choice of the installer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-ipc-start</span> As <span Class="manpage">-ipc</span>and starts the server at the other end as well.  Whether this option is available is the choice of the installer. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-jobname \ name</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">name</span> for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-kpathsea-debug \ bitmask</span> Sets path searching debugging flags according to the bitmask.  See the <span Class="emphasis">Kpathsea</span> manual for details. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-mktex \ fmt</span> Enable 
<p class="level0">where <span Class="emphasis">fmt</span> must be either <span Class="emphasis">tex</span> or <span Class="emphasis">tfm .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-mltex</span> Enable ML*(TX extensions.  Only effective in combination with <span Class="manpage">-ini .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-mktex \ fmt</span> Disable 
<p class="level0">where <span Class="emphasis">fmt</span> must be either <span Class="emphasis">tex</span> or <span Class="emphasis">tfm .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-output-comment \ string</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">string</span> for the <span Class="emphasis">DVI</span> file comment instead of the date. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-output-directory \ directory</span> Write output files in <span Class="emphasis">directory</span> instead of the current directory.  Look up input files in <span Class="emphasis">directory</span> first, the along the normal search path. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-parse-first-line</span> If the first line of the main input file begins with <span Class="emphasis">%&</span> parse it to look for a dump name or a <span Class="bold">-translate-file</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-parse-first-line</span> Disable parsing of the first line of the main input file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-progname \ name</span> Pretend to be program <span Class="emphasis">name .</span> This affects both the format used and the search paths. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-recorder</span> Enable the filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened for input and output in a file with extension <span Class="emphasis">.fls .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-shell-escape</span> Enable the <span Class="bold">\ewrite18{ command }</span> construct.  The <span Class="emphasis">command</span> can be any shell command.  This construct is normally disallowed for security reasons. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-no-shell-escape</span> Disable the <span Class="bold">\ewrite18{ command }</span> construct, even if it is enabled in the <span Class="emphasis">texmf.cnf</span> file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-src-specials</span> Insert source specials into the <span Class="emphasis">DVI</span> file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-src-specials \ where</span> Insert source specials in certain placed of the <span Class="emphasis">DVI</span> file. <span Class="emphasis">where</span> is a comma-separated value list: <span Class="emphasis">cr ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">display ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">hbox ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">math ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">par ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">parent ,</span> or <span Class="emphasis">vbox .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-translate-file \ tcxname</span> Use the <span Class="emphasis">tcxname</span> translation table to set the mapping of input characters and re-mapping of output characters. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-default-translate-file \ tcxname</span> Like <span Class="bold">-translate-file</span> except that a <span Class="emphasis">%&</span> line can overrule this setting. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-version</span> Print version information and exit. 
<p class="level0"><a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the `Path specifications' node) for precise details of how the environment variables are used. The <span Class="bold">kpsewhich</span> utility can be used to query the values of the variables. 
<p class="level0">One caveat: In most e-*(TX formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to e-*(TX, because ~ is an active character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other programs, such as *(MF, do not have this problem. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXMFOUTPUT</span> Normally, e-*(TX puts its output files in the current directory.  If any output file cannot be opened there, it tries to open it in the directory specified in the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT. There is no default value for that variable.  For example, if you say <span Class="emphasis">etex paper</span> and the current directory is not writable, if TEXMFOUTPUT has the value <span Class="emphasis">/tmp ,</span> e-*(TX attempts to create <span Class="emphasis">/tmp/paper.log</span> (and <span Class="emphasis">/tmp/paper.dvi ,</span> if any output is produced.)  TEXMFOUTPUT is also checked for input files, as *(TX often generates files that need to be subsequently read; for input, no suffixes (such as ``.tex'') are added by default, the input name is simply checked as given. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXINPUTS</span> Search path for <span Class="emphasis">\einput</span> and <span Class="emphasis">\eopenin</span> files. This should start with ``.'', so that user files are found before system files.  An empty path component will be replaced with the paths defined in the <span Class="emphasis">texmf.cnf</span> file.  For example, set TEXINPUTS to ".:/home/user/tex:" to prepend the current direcory and ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXFORMATS</span> Search path for format files. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXPOOL</span> search path for <span Class="bold">etex</span> internal strings. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TEXEDIT</span> Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually <span Class="manpage">vi</span>is set when e-*(TX is compiled. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">TFMFONTS</span> Search path for font metric 
<p class="level0">files. 
<p class="level0"><a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>
<p class="level0">The location of the files mentioned below varies from system to system.  Use the <span Class="bold">kpsewhich</span> utility to find their locations. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">etex.pool</span> Text file containing e-*(TX's internal strings. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">texfonts.map</span> Filename mapping definitions. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">*.tfm</span> Metric files for e-*(TX's fonts. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">*.fmt</span> Predigested e-*(TX format (.|fmt) files. 
<p class="level0"><a name="NOTES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">NOTES</h2>
<p class="level0">Starting with version 1.40, pdf*(TX incorporates the e-*(TX extensions, so in this installation e*(TX may be just a symbolic link to pdf*(TX.  See  <span Class="manpage">pdftex (1).</span>This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of e-*(TX can be found in the info manual <span Class="emphasis">Web2C: A TeX implementation .</span> 
<p class="level0"><a name="BUGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">BUGS</h2>
<p class="level0">This version of e-*(TX implements a number of optional extensions. In fact, many of these extensions conflict to a greater or lesser extent with the definition of e-*(TX.  When such extensions are enabled, the banner printed when e-*(TX starts is changed to print <span Class="bold">e-TeXk</span> instead of <span Class="manpage">e-TeX .</span>
<p class="level0">This version of e-*(TX fails to trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are added or subtracted.  Cases where this occurs are rare, but when it does the generated <span Class="emphasis">DVI</span> file will be invalid.
