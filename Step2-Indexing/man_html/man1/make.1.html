<p class="level0">make - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">make</span> [<span Class="emphasis">OPTION</span>]... [<span Class="emphasis">TARGET</span>]... <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">make</span> utility will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation of <span Class="manpage">make</span>which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are very common, but you can use <span Class="bold">make</span> with any programming language whose compiler can be run with a shell command. In fact, <span Class="bold">make</span> is not limited to programs.  You can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated automatically from others whenever the others change. 
<p class="level0">To prepare to use <span Class="manpage">make</span>you must write a file called the <span Class="emphasis">makefile</span> that describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states the commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files. 
<p class="level0">Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">make</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">suffices to perform all necessary recompilations. The <span Class="bold">make</span> program uses the makefile description and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of those files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">make</span> executes commands in the <span Class="emphasis">makefile</span> to update one or more target <span Class="emphasis">names ,</span> where <span Class="emphasis">name</span> is typically a program. If no <span Class="bold">-f</span> option is present, <span Class="bold">make</span> will look for the makefiles <span Class="emphasis">GNUmakefile ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">makefile ,</span> and <span Class="emphasis">Makefile ,</span> in that order. 
<p class="level0">Normally you should call your makefile either <span Class="emphasis">makefile</span> or <span Class="emphasis">Makefile .</span> (We recommend <span Class="emphasis">Makefile</span> because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files such as <span Class="emphasis">README .)</span> The first name checked, <span Class="emphasis">GNUmakefile ,</span> is not recommended for most makefiles.  You should use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU <span Class="manpage">make</span>and will not be understood by other versions of <span Class="manpage">make .</span>If <span Class="emphasis">makefile</span> is '-', the standard input is read. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">make</span> updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have been modified since the target was last modified, or if the target does not exist. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-b</span>, <span Class="bold">-m</span> These options are ignored for compatibility with other versions of <span Class="manpage">make .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-B</span>, <span Class="bold">--always-make</span> Unconditionally make all targets. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-C</span> <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>, <span Class="bold">--directory</span>=<span Class="emphasis">dir</span> Change to directory <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> before reading the makefiles or doing anything else. If multiple <span Class="bold">-C</span> options are specified, each is interpreted relative to the previous one: <span Class="manpage">-C  /</span>, <span Class="manpage">-C  etc</span>is equivalent to <span Class="manpage">-C  /etc.</span>This is typically used with recursive invocations of <span Class="manpage">make .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d</span> Print debugging information in addition to normal processing. The debugging information says which files are being considered for remaking, which file-times are being compared and with what results, which files actually need to be remade, which implicit rules are considered and which are applied---everything interesting about how <span Class="bold">make</span> decides what to do. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--debug [=FLAGS]</span> Print debugging information in addition to normal processing. If the <span Class="emphasis">FLAGS</span> are omitted, then the behavior is the same as if <span Class="bold">-d</span> was specified. <span Class="emphasis">FLAGS</span> may be <span Class="emphasis">a</span> for all debugging output (same as using <span Class="manpage">-d )</span><span Class="emphasis">b</span> for basic debugging, <span Class="emphasis">v</span> for more verbose basic debugging, <span Class="emphasis">i</span> for showing implicit rules, <span Class="emphasis">j</span> for details on invocation of commands, and <span Class="emphasis">m</span> for debugging while remaking makefiles.  Use <span Class="emphasis">n</span> to disable all previous debugging flags. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-e</span>, <span Class="bold">--environment-overrides</span> Give variables taken from the environment precedence over variables from makefiles. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f</span> <span Class="emphasis">file</span>, <span Class="bold">--file</span>=<span Class="emphasis">file</span>, <span Class="bold">--makefile</span>=<span Class="emphasis">FILE</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">file</span> as a makefile. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-i</span>, <span Class="bold">--ignore-errors</span> Ignore all errors in commands executed to remake files. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-I</span> <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>, <span Class="bold">--include-dir</span>=<span Class="emphasis">dir</span> Specifies a directory <span Class="emphasis">dir</span> to search for included makefiles. If several <span Class="bold">-I</span> options are used to specify several directories, the directories are searched in the order specified. Unlike the arguments to other flags of <span Class="manpage">make</span>directories given with <span Class="bold">-I</span> flags may come directly after the flag: <span Class="bold">-I dir</span> is allowed, as well as <span Class="bold">-I</span> <span Class="emphasis">dir .</span> This syntax is allowed for compatibility with the C preprocessor's <span Class="bold">-I</span> flag. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-j</span> [<span Class="emphasis">jobs</span>], <span Class="bold">--jobs</span>[=<span Class="emphasis">jobs</span>] Specifies the number of <span Class="emphasis">jobs</span> (commands) to run simultaneously. If there is more than one <span Class="bold">-j</span> option, the last one is effective. If the <span Class="bold">-j</span> option is given without an argument, , <span Class="manpage">make</span>will not limit the number of jobs that can run simultaneously. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-k</span>, <span Class="bold">--keep-going</span> Continue as much as possible after an error. While the target that failed, and those that depend on it, cannot be remade, the other dependencies of these targets can be processed all the same. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l</span> [<span Class="emphasis">load</span>], <span Class="bold">--load-average</span>[=<span Class="emphasis">load</span>] Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are others jobs running and the load average is at least <span Class="emphasis">load</span> (a floating-point number). With no argument, removes a previous load limit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-L</span>, <span Class="bold">--check-symlink-times</span> Use the latest mtime between symlinks and target. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-n</span>, <span Class="bold">--just-print</span>, <span Class="bold">--dry-run</span>, <span Class="bold">--recon</span> Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them (except in certain circumstances). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-o</span> <span Class="emphasis">file</span>, <span Class="bold">--old-file</span>=<span Class="emphasis">file</span>, <span Class="bold">--assume-old</span>=<span Class="emphasis">file</span> Do not remake the file <span Class="emphasis">file</span> even if it is older than its dependencies, and do not remake anything on account of changes in <span Class="emphasis">file .</span> Essentially the file is treated as very old and its rules are ignored. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-O</span>[<span Class="emphasis">type</span>], <span Class="bold">--output-sync</span>[=<span Class="emphasis">type</span>] When running multiple jobs in parallel with <span Class="bold">-j</span>, ensure the output of each job is collected together rather than interspersed with output from other jobs.  If <span Class="emphasis">type</span> is not specified or is <span Class="bold">target</span> the output from the entire recipe for each target is grouped together.  If <span Class="emphasis">type</span> is <span Class="bold">line</span> the output from each command line within a recipe is grouped together. If <span Class="emphasis">type</span> is <span Class="bold">recurse</span> output from an entire recursive make is grouped together.  If <span Class="emphasis">type</span> is <span Class="bold">none</span> output synchronization is disabled. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p</span>, <span Class="bold">--print-data-base</span> Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results from reading the makefiles; then execute as usual or as otherwise specified. This also prints the version information given by the <span Class="bold">-v</span> switch (see below). To print the data base without trying to remake any files, use <span Class="emphasis">make -p -f/dev/null .</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-q</span>, <span Class="bold">--question</span> ``Question mode''. Do not run any commands, or print anything; just return an exit status that is zero if the specified targets are already up to date, nonzero otherwise. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-r</span>, <span Class="bold">--no-builtin-rules</span> Eliminate use of the built-in implicit rules. Also clear out the default list of suffixes for suffix rules. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-R</span>, <span Class="bold">--no-builtin-variables</span> Don't define any built-in variables. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s</span>, <span Class="bold">--silent</span>, <span Class="bold">--quiet</span> Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-S</span>, <span Class="bold">--no-keep-going</span>, <span Class="bold">--stop</span> Cancel the effect of the <span Class="bold">-k</span> option. This is never necessary except in a recursive <span Class="bold">make</span> where <span Class="bold">-k</span> might be inherited from the top-level <span Class="bold">make</span> via MAKEFLAGS or if you set <span Class="bold">-k</span> in MAKEFLAGS in your environment. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t</span>, <span Class="bold">--touch</span> Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them) instead of running their commands. This is used to pretend that the commands were done, in order to fool future invocations of <span Class="manpage">make .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--trace</span> Information about the disposition of each target is printed (why the target is being rebuilt and what commands are run to rebuild it). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span>, <span Class="bold">--version</span> Print the version of the <span Class="bold">make</span> program plus a copyright, a list of authors and a notice that there is no warranty. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-w</span>, <span Class="bold">--print-directory</span> Print a message containing the working directory before and after other processing. This may be useful for tracking down errors from complicated nests of recursive <span Class="bold">make</span> commands. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-print-directory</span> Turn off <span Class="manpage">-w</span>even if it was turned on implicitly. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-W</span> <span Class="emphasis">file</span>, <span Class="bold">--what-if</span>=<span Class="emphasis">file</span>, <span Class="bold">--new-file</span>=<span Class="emphasis">file</span>, <span Class="bold">--assume-new</span>=<span Class="emphasis">file</span> Pretend that the target <span Class="emphasis">file</span> has just been modified. When used with the <span Class="bold">-n</span> flag, this shows you what would happen if you were to modify that file. Without <span Class="manpage">-n</span>it is almost the same as running a <span Class="emphasis">touch</span> command on the given file before running <span Class="manpage">make</span>except that the modification time is changed only in the imagination of <span Class="manpage">make .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--warn-undefined-variables</span> Warn when an undefined variable is referenced. <a name="EXIT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EXIT STATUS</h2>
<p class="level0">GNU <span Class="bold">make</span> exits with a status of zero if all makefiles were successfully parsed and no targets that were built failed.  A status of one will be returned if the <span Class="bold">-q</span> flag was used and <span Class="bold">make</span> determines that a target needs to be rebuilt.  A status of two will be returned if any errors were encountered. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
