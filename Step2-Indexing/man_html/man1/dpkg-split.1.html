<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dpkg-split</span> splits Debian binary package files into smaller parts and reassembles them again, to support the storage of large package files on small media such as floppy disks. 
<p class="level0">It can be operated manually using the <span Class="manpage">--split</span>, <span Class="manpage">--join  and  --info</span>options. 
<p class="level0">It also has an automatic mode, invoked using the <span Class="bold">--auto</span> option, where it maintains a queue of parts seen but not yet reassembled and reassembles a package file when it has seen all of its parts. The <span Class="manpage">--listq  and  --discard</span>options allow the management of the queue. 
<p class="level0">All splitting, joining and queueing operations produce informative messages on standard output; these may safely be ignored.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-s</span>, <span Class="manpage">--split  \fIcomplete-archive\fP [\fIprefix\fP]</span>Splits a single Debian binary package into several parts. 
<p class="level0">The parts are named 
<p class="level0">where <span Class="emphasis">N</span> is the part number, starting at 1, and <span Class="emphasis">M</span> is the total number of parts (both in decimal). 
<p class="level0">If no <span Class="emphasis">prefix</span> is supplied then the <span Class="emphasis">complete-archive</span> filename is taken, including directory, with any trailing <span Class="bold">.deb</span> removed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-j</span>, <span Class="manpage">--join  \fIpart\fP...</span>Joins the parts of a package file together, reassembling the original file as it was before it was split. 
<p class="level0">The part files given as arguments must be all the parts of exactly the same original binary file. Each part must occur exactly once in the argument list, though the parts to not need to be listed in order. 
<p class="level0">The parts must of course all have been generated with the same part size specified at split time, which means that they must usually have been generated by the same invocation of <span Class="manpage">dpkg-split --split .</span>
<p class="level0">The parts' filenames are not significant for the reassembly process. 
<p class="level0">By default the output file is called 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-I</span>, <span Class="manpage">--info  \fIpart\fP...</span>Prints information, in a human-readable format, about the part file(s) specified. Arguments which are not binary package parts produce a message saying so instead (but still on standard output). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-a</span>, <span Class="manpage">--auto -o  \fIcomplete-output part\fP</span>Automatically queue parts and reassemble a package if possible. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">part</span> specified is examined, and compared with other parts of the same package (if any) in the queue of packages file parts. 
<p class="level0">If all parts of the package file of which <span Class="emphasis">part</span> is a part are available then the package is reassembled and written to <span Class="emphasis">complete-output</span> (which should not usually already exist, though this is not an error). 
<p class="level0">If not then the <span Class="emphasis">part</span> is copied into the queue and <span Class="emphasis">complete-output</span> is not created. 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">part</span> is not a split binary package part then <span Class="bold">dpkg-split</span> will exit with status <span Class="bold">1</span>; if some other trouble occurs then it will exit with status <span Class="bold">2</span>. 
<p class="level0">The , <span Class="manpage">--output  or  -o</span>option must be supplied when using <span Class="manpage">--auto .</span>(If this were not mandatory the calling program would not know what output file to expect.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-l</span>, <span Class="manpage">--listq</span>Lists the contents of the queue of packages to be reassembled. 
<p class="level0">For each package file of which parts are in the queue the output gives the name of the package, the parts in the queue, and the total number of bytes stored in the queue. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-d</span>, <span Class="manpage">--discard  [\fIpackage\fP...]</span>This discards parts from the queue of those waiting for the remaining parts of their packages. 
<p class="level0">If no <span Class="emphasis">package</span> is specified then the queue is cleared completely; if any are specified then only parts of the relevant package(s) are deleted. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-?</span>, <span Class="manpage">--help</span>Show the usage message and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">--version</span>Show the version and exit. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--depotdir  directory</span> Specifies an alternative directory for the queue of parts awaiting automatic reassembly. The default is <span Class="manpage">/var/lib/dpkg .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-S</span>, <span Class="manpage">--partsize  \fIkibibytes\fP</span>Specifies the maximum part size when splitting, in kibibytes (1024 bytes). The default is 450 KiB. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-o</span>, <span Class="manpage">--output  \fIcomplete-output\fP</span>Specifies the output file name for a reassembly. 
<p class="level0">This overrides the default for a manual reassembly 
<p class="level0">and is mandatory for an automatic queue-or-reassemble 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">-Q</span>, <span Class="manpage">--npquiet</span>When doing automatic queue-or-reassembly <span Class="bold">dpkg-split</span> usually prints a message if it is given a <span Class="emphasis">part</span> that is not a binary package part. This option suppresses this message, to allow programs such as <span Class="bold">dpkg</span> to cope with both split and unsplit packages without producing spurious messages. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">--msdos</span>Forces the output filenames generated by <span Class="bold">--split</span> to be msdos-compatible. 
<p class="level0">This mangles the prefix - either the default derived from the input filename or the one supplied as an argument: alphanumerics are lowercased, plus signs are replaced by <span Class="manpage">x 's</span>and all other characters are discarded. 
<p class="level0">The result is then truncated as much as is necessary, and filenames of the form 
<p class="level0">are generated. 
<p class="level0"><a name="EXIT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EXIT STATUS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">0</span> The requested split, merge, or other command succeeded. <span Class="bold">--info</span> commands count as successful even if the files are not binary package parts. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">1</span> Only occurs with <span Class="bold">--auto</span> and indicates that the <span Class="emphasis">part</span> file was not a binary package part. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">2</span> Some kind of trouble happened, such as a system call failure, a file that looked like a package part file but was corrupted, a usage error or some other problem. 
<p class="level0"><a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">/var/lib/dpkg/parts</span> The default queue directory for part files awaiting automatic reassembly. 
<p class="level0">The filenames used in this directory are in a format internal to <span Class="bold">dpkg-split</span> and are unlikely to be useful to other programs, and in any case the filename format should not be relied upon.

<p class="level0">Full details of the packages in the queue are impossible to get without digging into the queue directory yourself. 
<p class="level0">There is no easy way to test whether a file that may be a binary package part is one.
