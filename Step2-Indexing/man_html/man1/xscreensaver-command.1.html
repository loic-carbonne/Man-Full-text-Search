<p class="level0">xscreensaver-command - control a running xscreensaver process <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">xscreensaver-command</span> [-display <span Class="emphasis">host:display.screen</span>] \ [-help | \ -demo | \ -prefs | \ -activate | \ -deactivate | \ -cycle | \ -next | \ -prev | \ -select <span Class="emphasis">n</span> | \ -exit | \ -restart | \ -lock | \ -version | \ -time | \ -watch] <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-command</span> program controls a running <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> process by sending it client-messages. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="manpage">xscreensaver (1)</span>has a client-server model: the xscreensaver process is a daemon that runs in the background; it is controlled by other foreground programs such as <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-command</span> and <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1).</span>
<p class="level0">This program, <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-command</span>, is a command-line-oriented tool; the  <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1).</span>program is a graphical tool. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-command</span> accepts the following command-line options: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-help</span> Prints a brief summary of command-line options. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-demo</span> This just launches the , <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>program, in which one can experiment with the various graphics hacks available, and edit parameters. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-demo number</span> When the <span Class="emphasis">-demo</span> option is followed by an integer, it instructs  the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> daemon to run that hack, and wait for the user to click the mouse before deactivating (i.e., mouse motion does not deactivate.)  This is the mechanism by which <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>communicates with the <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver (1)</span>daemon.  (The first hack in the list is numbered 1, not 0.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-prefs</span> Like the no-argument form of <span Class="emphasis">-demo</span>, but brings up that program's Preferences panel by default. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-activate</span> Tell xscreensaver to turn on immediately (that is, blank the screen, as if the user had been idle for long enough.)  The screensaver will deactivate as soon as there is any user activity, as usual. 
<p class="level0">It is useful to run this from a menu; you may wish to run it as 
<p class="level0">sleep 5 ; xscreensaver-command -activate 
<p class="level0">to be sure that you have time to take your hand off the mouse before the screensaver comes on.  (Because if you jiggle the mouse, xscreensaver will notice, and deactivate.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-deactivate</span> This tells xscreensaver to pretend that there has just been user activity. This means that if the screensaver is active (the screen is blanked), then this command will cause the screen to un-blank as if there had been keyboard or mouse activity.  If the screen is locked, then the password dialog will pop up first, as usual.  If the screen is not blanked, then this simulated user activity will re-start the countdown (so, issuing the <span Class="emphasis">-deactivate</span> command periodically is <span Class="emphasis">one</span> way to prevent the screen from blanking.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-cycle</span> If the screensaver is active (the screen is blanked), then stop the current graphics demo and run a new one (chosen randomly.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-next</span> This is like either <span Class="emphasis">-activate</span> or <span Class="emphasis">-cycle</span>, depending on which is more appropriate, except that the graphics hack that will be run is the next one in the list, instead of a randomly-chosen one.  In other words,  repeatedly executing -next will cause the xscreensaver process to invoke each graphics demo sequentially.  (Though using the <span Class="emphasis">-demo</span> option is probably an easier way to accomplish that.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-prev</span> This is like <span Class="emphasis">-next</span>, but cycles in the other direction. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-select number</span> Like <span Class="emphasis">-activate</span>, but runs the <span Class="emphasis">N</span>th element in the list of hacks. By knowing what is in the <span Class="emphasis">programs</span> list, and in what order, you can use this to activate the screensaver with a particular graphics demo.  (The first element in the list is numbered 1, not 0.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-exit</span> Causes the xscreensaver process to exit gracefully.   This does nothing if the display is currently locked. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Warning:</span> never use <span Class="emphasis">kill -9</span> with <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> while the screensaver is active.  If you are using a virtual root window manager, that can leave things in an inconsistent state, and you may need to restart your window manager to repair the damage. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-lock</span> Tells the running xscreensaver process to lock the screen immediately.   This is like <span Class="emphasis">-activate</span>, but forces locking as well, even if locking is not the default (that is, even if xscreensaver's <span Class="emphasis">lock</span> resource is false, and even if the <span Class="emphasis">lockTimeout</span> resource is non-zero.) 
<p class="level0">Note that locking doesn't work unless the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> process is running as you.  See  <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver (1)</span>for details. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-version</span> Prints the version of xscreensaver that is currently running on the display: that is, the actual version number of the running xscreensaver background  process, rather than the version number of xscreensaver-command.  (To see the version number of <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-command</span> itself, use  the <span Class="emphasis">-help</span> option.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-time</span> Prints the time at which the screensaver last activated or  deactivated (roughly, how long the user has been idle or non-idle: but  not quite, since it only tells you when the screen became blanked or un-blanked.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-restart</span> Causes the screensaver process to exit and then restart with the same command line arguments as last time.  You shouldn't really need to do this, since xscreensaver notices when the <span Class="emphasis">.xscreensaver</span> file has changed and re-reads it as needed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-watch</span> Prints a line each time the screensaver changes state: when the screen blanks, locks, unblanks, or when the running hack is changed.  This option never returns; it is intended for use by shell scripts that want to react to the screensaver in some way.  An example of its output would be: 
<p class="level0">BLANK Fri Nov  5 01:57:22 1999 RUN 34 RUN 79 RUN 16 LOCK Fri Nov  5 01:57:22 1999 RUN 76 RUN 12 UNBLANK Fri Nov  5 02:05:59 1999 
<p class="level0">The above shows the screensaver activating, running three different hacks, then locking (perhaps because the lock-timeout went off) then unblanking (because the user became active, and typed the correct password.)  The hack numbers are their index in the `programs' list (starting with 1, not 0, as for the <span Class="emphasis">-select</span> command.) 
<p class="level0">For example, suppose you want to run a program that turns down the volume on your machine when the screen blanks, and turns it back up when the screen un-blanks.  You could do that by running a Perl program like the following in the background.  The following program tracks the output of  the <span Class="emphasis">-watch</span> command and reacts accordingly: 
<p class="level0">&#35;!/usr/bin/perl 
<p class="level0">my $blanked = 0; open (IN, "xscreensaver-command -watch |"); while (&lt;IN&gt;) { &nbsp;   if (m/^(BLANK|LOCK)/) { &nbsp;       if (!$blanked) { &nbsp;           system "sound-off"; &nbsp;           $blanked = 1; &nbsp;       } &nbsp;   } elsif (m/^UNBLANK/) { &nbsp;       system "sound-on"; &nbsp;       $blanked = 0; &nbsp;   } } 
<p class="level0">Note that LOCK might come either with or without a preceding BLANK (depending on whether the lock-timeout is non-zero), so the above program keeps track of both of them. <a name="STOPPING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">STOPPING GRAPHICS</h2>
<p class="level0">If xscreensaver is running, but you want it to stop running screen hacks (e.g., if you are logged in remotely, and you want the console to remain locked but just be black, with no graphics processes running) you can  accomplish that by simply powering down the monitor remotely.  In a minute or so, xscreensaver will notice that the monitor is off, and will stop running screen hacks.  You can power off the monitor like so: 
<p class="level0">xset dpms force off 
<p class="level0">See the <span Class="manpage">xset (1)</span>manual for more info. 
<p class="level0">You can also use <span Class="manpage">xscreensaver-demo (1)</span>to make the monitor power down after a few hours, meaning that xscreensaver will run graphics until it has been idle for the length of time you specified; and after that, the monitor will power off, and screen hacks will stop being run. <a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
<p class="level0">If an error occurs while communicating with the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> daemon, or if the daemon reports an error, a diagnostic message will be printed to stderr, and <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-command</span> will exit with a non-zero value.  If the command is accepted, an indication of this will be printed to stdout, and the exit value will be zero. <a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">DISPLAY</span> to get the host and display number of the screen whose saver is to be manipulated. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PATH</span> to find the executable to restart (for the <span Class="emphasis">-restart</span> command).   Note that this variable is consulted in the environment of  the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver</span> process, not the <span Class="emphasis">xscreensaver-command</span> process. <a name="UPGRADES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">UPGRADES</h2>
