<p class="level0">ucfr - Update Configuration File Registry:  associate packages with configuration files <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ucfr</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">&lt;Package&gt;</span> <span Class="emphasis">&lt;Path to configuration file&gt;</span> <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">Where <span Class="emphasis">Package</span> is the package associated with the configuration file (and, in some sense, its owner), and <span Class="emphasis">Path to configuration file</span> is the full path to the location (usually under /etc) where the configuration file lives, and is potentially modified by the end user. Please note that usually this means that we register actual files, and not symbolic links to files. <span Class="bold">ucfr</span> will follow symbolic links and register the real file,  and not the symbolic link. 
<p class="level0">This script maintains an association between configuration files and packages, and is meant to help provide facilities that <span Class="emphasis">dpkg</span> provides conffiles for configuration files and not shipped in a <span Class="bold">Debian</span> package, but handled by the postinst by <span Class="emphasis">ucf</span> instead. This script is idempotent, associating a package to a file multiple times is not an error.  It is normally an error to try to associate a file which is already associated with another package, but this can be over ridden by using the <span Class="emphasis">--force</span> option. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-h, --help</span> Print a short usage message 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-n, --no-action</span> Dry run. Print the actions that would be taken if the script is invoked, but take no action. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d [n], --debug [n]</span> Set the debug level to the (optional) level <span Class="emphasis">n</span> (n defaults to 1). This turns on copious debugging information. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p, --purge</span> Removes all vestiges of the association between the named package and the configuration file from the registry. The association must already exist; if the configuration file is associated with some other package, an error happens, unless the option <span Class="emphasis">--force</span> is also given. In that case, the any associations for the configuration file are removed from the registry, whether or not the package name matches. This action is idempotent, asking for an association to be purged multiple times does not result in an error, since attempting to remove an non-existent association is silently ignored unless the <span Class="emphasis">--verbose</span> option is used (in which case it just issues a diagnostic). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v, --verbose</span> Make the script be very verbose about setting internal variables. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-f, --force</span> This option forces operations requested even if the configuration file in consideration is owned by another package. This allows a package to <span Class="emphasis">hijack</span> a configuration file from another package, or to purge the association between the file and some other package in the registry. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--state-dir /path/to/dir</span> Set the state directory to /path/to/dir instead of the default <span Class="emphasis">/var/lib/ucf.</span> Used mostly for testing. <a name="USAGE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USAGE</h2>
<p class="level0">The most common case usage is pretty simple: a single line invocation in the postinst on configure, and another single line in the postrm to tell <span Class="bold">ucfr</span> to forget about the association with the configuration file on purge (using the  --purge option) is all that is needed (assuming ucfr is still on the system). <a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">/var/lib/ucf/registry,</span> and <span Class="emphasis">/var/lib/ucf/registry.X,</span> where <span Class="emphasis">X</span> is a small integer, where previous versions of the registry are stored. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">/etc/ucf.conf</span> <a name="EXAMPLES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EXAMPLES</h2>
<p class="level0">If the package <span Class="emphasis">foo</span> wants to use ucfr to associate itself with a configuration file <span Class="emphasis">foo.conf,</span> a simple invocation of ucfr in the postinst file is all that is needed: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ucfr</span> <span Class="emphasis">foo</span> <span Class="emphasis">/etc/foo.conf</span> 
<p class="level0">On purge, one should tell ucf to forget about the file (see detailed examples in /usr/share/doc/examples): 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ucfr</span> <span Class="emphasis">--purge</span> <span Class="emphasis">foo</span> <span Class="emphasis">/etc/foo.conf</span> <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
