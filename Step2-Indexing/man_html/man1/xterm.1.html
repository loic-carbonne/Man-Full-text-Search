<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">\*n</span> [-<span Class="emphasis">toolkitoption</span> ...] [-<span Class="emphasis">option</span> ...] [<span Class="emphasis">shell</span>] <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and selected features from higher-level terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VTxxx). It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly. If the underlying operating system supports terminal resizing capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will use the facilities to notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The VTxxx and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so that you can edit text in one and look at graphics in the other at the same time. To maintain the correct aspect ratio (height/width), Tektronix graphics will be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's aspect ratio that will fit in the window. This box is located in the upper left area of the window. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is considered the *(``active*('' window for receiving keyboard input and terminal output. This is the window that contains the text cursor. The active window can be chosen through escape sequences, the *(``VT Options*('' menu in the VTxxx window, and the *(``Tek Options*('' menu in the 4014 window. 
<p class="level0"><a name="EMULATIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">EMULATIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The VT102 emulation is fairly complete, but does not support autorepeat. Double-size characters are displayed properly if your font server supports scalable fonts. The VT220 emulation does not support soft fonts, it is otherwise complete. 
<p class="level0">Terminal database (<span Class="emphasis">terminfo</span> (5) or <span Class="emphasis">termcap</span> (5)) entries that work with <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> include 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">an optional platform-specific entry (*(``xterm*(''), <br>*(``xterm*('', <br>*(``vt102*('', <br>*(``vt100*('', <br>*(``ansi*('' and <br>*(``dumb*('' 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">*N</span> automatically searches the terminal database in this order for these entries and then sets the *(``TERM*('' and the *(``TERMCAP*('' environment variables. You may also use *(``vt220*('',  but must set the terminal emulation level with the <span Class="bold">decTerminalID</span> resource. On most systems, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will use the terminfo database. Some older systems use termcap. (The *(``TERMCAP*('' environment variable is not set if <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is linked against a terminfo library, since the requisite information is not provided by the termcap emulation of terminfo libraries). 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Many of the special <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> features may be modified under program control through a set of escape sequences different from the standard VT102 escape sequences. (See the <span Class="emphasis">Xterm Control Sequences</span> document.) 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">The Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good. It supports 12-bit graphics addressing, scaled to the window size. Four different font sizes and five different lines types are supported. There is no write-through or defocused mode support. The Tektronix text and graphics commands are recorded internally by <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> and may be written to a file by sending the COPY escape sequence (or through the <span Class="bold">Tektronix</span> menu; see below). The name of the file will be *(``<span class="bold">COPY<span class="emphasis">yyyy<span class="bold">-<span class="emphasis">MM<span class="bold">-<span class="emphasis">dd<span class="bold">.<span class="emphasis">hh<span class="bold">:<span class="emphasis">mm<span class="bold">:<span Class="emphasis">ss</span>*('', where <span Class="emphasis">yyyy ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">MM ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">dd ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">hh ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">mm</span> and <span Class="emphasis">ss</span> are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second when the COPY was performed (the file is created in the directory <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> is started in, or the home directory for a login <span Class="emphasis">\*n ).</span> 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Not all of the features described in this manual are necessarily available in this version of <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. Some (e.g., the non-VT220 extensions) are available only if they were compiled in, though the most commonly-used are in the default configuration. 
<p class="level1"><a name="OTHER"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OTHER FEATURES</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">*N</span> automatically highlights the text cursor when the pointer enters the window (selected) and unhighlights it when the pointer leaves the window (unselected). If the window is the focus window, then the text cursor is highlighted no matter where the pointer is. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate an alternate screen buffer, which is the same size as the display area of the window. When activated, the current screen is saved and replaced with the alternate screen. Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window is disabled until the normal screen is restored. The usual terminal description for <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> allows the visual editor <span Class="emphasis">vi (1)</span> to switch to the alternate screen for editing and to restore the screen on exit. A popup menu entry makes it simple to switch between the normal and alternate screens for cut and paste. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape sequences to change the name of the windows. Additionally, in VT102 mode, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> implements the window-manipulation control sequences from <span Class="emphasis">dtterm</span>, such as resizing the window, setting its location on the screen. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">*N</span> allows character-based applications to receive mouse events (currently button-press and release events, and button-motion events) as keyboard control sequences. See <span Class="emphasis">Xterm Control Sequences</span> for details. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> terminal emulator accepts the standard X Toolkit command line options as well as many application-specific options. If the option begins with a 
<p class="level0">instead of a 
<p class="level0">the option is restored to its default value. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-version</span> This causes <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to print a version number to the standard output, and then exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-help</span> This causes <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to print out a verbose message describing its options, one per line. The message is written to the standard output. After printing the message, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> exits. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span> generates this message, sorting it and noting whether a *(``<span Class="bold">-</span><span Class="emphasis">option</span>*('' or a *(``<a class="bold" href="#">+</a><span Class="emphasis">option</span>*('' turns the feature on or off, since some features historically have been one or the other. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span> generates a concise help message (multiple options per line) when an unknown option is used, e.g., 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">*n -z</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>, the help text for that option also is not displayed by the <span Class="bold">-help</span> option. 
<p class="level1">Most of the <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> options are actually parsed by the X Toolkit, which sets resource values. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span> provides the X Toolkit with a table of options. A few of these are marked, telling the X Toolkit to ignore them (<span Class="bold">-help</span>, <span Class="bold">-version</span>, <span Class="bold">-class</span>, <span Class="bold">-e</span>, and <span Class="bold">-into</span>). After the X Toolkit has parsed the command-line parameters, it removes those which it handles, leaving the specially-marked parameters for <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to handle. 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="bold">-version</span> and <span Class="bold">-help</span> options are interpreted even if <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> cannot open the display, and are useful for testing and configuration scripts. Along with <span Class="bold">-class</span>, they are checked before other options. To do this, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> has its own (much simpler) argument parser, along with a table of the X Toolkit's built-in list of options. 
<p class="level1">Relying upon the X Toolkit to parse the options and associated values has the advantages of simplicity and good integration with the X resource mechanism. There are a few drawbacks 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">*N</span> cannot tell easily whether a resource value was set by one of the external resource- or application-defaults files, or if it was set through the <span Class="bold">-xrm</span> option or via some directly relevant command-line option. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span> sees only the end-result: a value supplied when creating its widgets. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">*N</span> does not know the order in which particular options and items in resource files are evaluated. Rather, it sees all of the values for a given widget at the same time. In the design of these options, some are deemed more important, and can override other options. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The X Toolkit uses patterns (constants and wildcards) to match resources. Once a particular pattern has been used, it will not modify it. To override a given setting, a more-specific pattern must be used, e.g., replacing *(``**('' with *(``.*(''. Some poorly-designed resource files are too specific to allow the command-line options to affect the relevant widget values. 
<p class="level1">In a few cases, the X Toolkit combines its standard options in ways which do not work well with <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. This happens with the color (<span Class="bold">-fg</span>, <span Class="bold">-B</span>) and reverse (<span Class="bold">-rv</span>) options. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span> makes a special case of these and adjusts its sense of *(``reverse*('' to lessen user surprise. 
<p class="level1">One parameter (after all options) may be given. That overrides <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>'s built-in choice of shell program: 
<p class="level1">If the parameter is not a relative path, i.e., beginning with *(``./*('' or *(``../*('', <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> looks for the file in the user's PATH. In either case, this check fails if <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> cannot construct an absolute path. 
<p class="level1">If that check fails (or if no such parameter is given), <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> next checks the *(``SHELL*('' variable. If that specifies an executable file, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will attempt to start that. However, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> additionally checks if it is a valid shell, and will unset *(``SHELL*('' if it is not. 
<p class="level1">If *(``SHELL*('' is not set to an executable file, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> tries to use the shell program specified in the user's password file entry. As before, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> verifies if this is a valid shell. 
<p class="level1">Finally, if the password file entry does not specify a valid shell, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> uses <span Class="emphasis">/bin/sh</span>. 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="bold">-e</span> option cannot be used with this parameter since it uses all parameters following the option. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">*N</span> validates shell programs by finding their pathname in the text file <span Class="bold">/etc/shells</span>. It treats the environment variable *(``SHELL*('' specially because (like *(``TERM*(''), <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> both reads and updates the variable, and because the program started by <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is not necessarily a shell. 
<p class="level1">The other options are used to control the appearance and behavior. Not all options are necessarily configured into your copy of <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>: 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-132</span> Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that switches between 80 and 132 column mode is ignored. This option causes the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized, and the <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> window will resize appropriately. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ah</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> should always highlight the text cursor. By default, <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> will display a hollow text cursor whenever the focus is lost or the pointer leaves the window. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+ah</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> should do text cursor highlighting based on focus. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ai</span> This option disables active icon support if that feature was compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. This is equivalent to setting the <span Class="emphasis">vt100</span> resource <span Class="bold">activeIcon</span> to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+ai</span> This option enables active icon support if that feature was compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. This is equivalent to setting the <span Class="emphasis">vt100</span> resource <span Class="bold">activeIcon</span> to *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-aw</span> This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed. This allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the beginning of the next line when it is at the rightmost position of a line and text is output. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+aw</span> This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be allowed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-b  number</span> This option specifies the size of the inner border (the distance between the outer edge of the characters and the window border) in pixels. That is the <span Class="emphasis">vt100</span> <span Class="emphasis">internalBorder</span> resource. The default is *(``2*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+bc</span> turn off text cursor blinking. This overrides the <span Class="bold">cursorBlink</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-bc</span> turn on text cursor blinking. This overrides the <span Class="bold">cursorBlink</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-bcf  milliseconds</span> set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the <span Class="emphasis">cursorOffTime</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-bcn  milliseconds</span> set the amount of time text cursor is on when blinking via the <span Class="emphasis">cursorOffTime</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-bdc</span> Set the <span Class="emphasis">vt100</span> resource <span Class="bold">colorBDMode</span> to *(``false*('', disabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+bdc</span> Set the <span Class="emphasis">vt100</span> resource <span Class="bold">colorBDMode</span> to *(``true*('', enabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color rather than bold 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cb</span> Set the <span Class="emphasis">vt100</span> resource <span Class="bold">cutToBeginningOfLine</span> to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+cb</span> Set the <span Class="emphasis">vt100</span> resource <span Class="bold">cutToBeginningOfLine</span> to *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cc characterclassrange:value[,...]</span> This sets classes indicated by the given ranges for using in selecting by words. See the section specifying character classes. and discussion of the <span Class="emphasis">charClass</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cjk_width</span> Set the <span Class="bold">cjkWidth</span> resource to *(``true*(''. When turned on, characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11 have a column width of 2. Otherwise, they have a column width of 1. This may be useful for some legacy CJK text terminal-based programs assuming box drawings and others to have a column width of 2. It also should be turned on when you specify a TrueType CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) font either with <span Class="bold">-fa</span> at the command line or <span Class="bold">faceName</span> resource. The default is *(``false*('' 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+cjk_width</span> Reset the <span Class="bold">cjkWidth</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-class  string</span> This option allows you to override <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>'s resource class. Normally it is *(``XTerm*('', but can be set to another class such as *(``UXTerm*('' to override selected resources. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cm</span> This option disables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences. It sets the <span Class="emphasis">colorMode</span> resource to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+cm</span> This option enables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences. This is the same as the <span Class="emphasis">vt100</span> resource <span Class="bold">colorMode</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cn</span> This option indicates that newlines should not be cut in line-mode selections. It sets the <span Class="emphasis">cutNewline</span> resource to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+cn</span> This option indicates that newlines should be cut in line-mode selections. It sets the <span Class="emphasis">cutNewline</span> resource to *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cr  color</span> This option specifies the color to use for text cursor. The default is to use the same foreground color that is used for text. It sets the <span Class="emphasis">cursorColor</span> resource according to the parameter. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-cu</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should work around a bug in the <span Class="emphasis">more (1)</span> program that causes it to incorrectly display lines that are exactly the width of the window and are followed by a line beginning with a tab (the leading tabs are not displayed). This option is so named because it was originally thought to be a bug in the <span Class="emphasis">curses (3x)</span> cursor motion package. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+cu</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not work around the <span Class="emphasis">more (1)</span> bug mentioned above. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-dc</span> This option disables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors: the vt100 foreground and background colors, its text cursor color, the pointer cursor foreground and background colors, the Tektronix emulator foreground and background colors, its text cursor color and highlight color. The option sets the <span Class="emphasis">dynamicColors</span> option to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+dc</span> This option enables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors. The option sets the <span Class="emphasis">dynamicColors</span> option to *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-e  program [ arguments .\|.\|. ]</span> This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be run in the <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> window. It also sets the window title and icon name to be the basename of the program being executed if neither <span Class="emphasis">-T</span> nor <span Class="emphasis">-n</span> are given on the command line. <span Class="bold">This must be the last option on the command line.</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-en  encoding</span> This option determines the encoding on which <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> runs. It sets the <span Class="bold">locale</span> resource. Encodings other than UTF-8 are supported by using <span Class="emphasis">luit</span>. The <span Class="bold">-lc</span> option should be used instead of <span Class="bold">-en</span> for systems with locale support. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fb  font</span> This option specifies a font to be used when displaying bold text. It sets the <span Class="bold">boldFont</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored. If only one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the normal font and the bold font will be produced by overstriking this font. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">See also the discussion of <span Class="bold">boldMode</span> and <span Class="bold">alwaysBoldMode</span> resources. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fa  pattern</span> This option sets the pattern for fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that library was compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">faceName</span> resource. When a CJK double-width font is specified, you also need to turn on the <span Class="bold">cjkWidth</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">See also the <span Class="bold">renderFont</span> resource, which combines with this to determine whether FreeType fonts are initially active. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fbb</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should compare normal and bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure they are compatible. It sets the <span Class="bold">freeBoldBox</span> resource to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+fbb</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not compare normal and bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure they are compatible. It sets the <span Class="bold">freeBoldBox</span> resource to *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fbx</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not assume that the normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters. If any are missing, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will draw the characters directly. It sets the <span Class="bold">forceBoxChars</span> resource to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+fbx</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should assume that the normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters. It sets the <span Class="bold">forceBoxChars</span> resource to *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fd  pattern</span> This option sets the pattern for double-width fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that library was compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">faceNameDoublesize</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fi  font</span> This option sets the font for active icons if that feature was compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">See also the discussion of the <span Class="bold">iconFont</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fs  size</span> This option sets the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that library was compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">faceSize</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fullscreen</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should ask the window manager to let it use the full-screen for display, e.g., without window decorations. It sets the <span Class="bold">fullscreen</span> resource to *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+fullscreen</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not ask the window manager to let it use the full-screen for display. It sets the <span Class="bold">fullscreen</span> resource to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fw font</span> This option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text. By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw normal text. If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal font. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">wideFont</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-fwb font</span> This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text. By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text. If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the bold font. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">wideBoldFont</span> resource.

It sets the <span Class="bold">highlightColorMode</span> resource to *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-hold</span> Turn on the <span Class="bold">hold</span> resource, i.e., <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will not immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes. It will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+hold</span> Turn off the <span Class="bold">hold</span> resource, i.e., <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ie</span> Turn on the <span Class="bold">ptyInitialErase</span> resource, i.e., use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the <span Class="emphasis">stty</span> erase value. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+ie</span> Turn off the <span Class="bold">ptyInitialErase</span> resource, i.e., set the <span Class="emphasis">stty</span> erase value using the <span Class="bold">kb</span> string from the termcap entry as a reference, if available. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-im</span> Turn on the <span Class="bold">useInsertMode</span> resource, which forces use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP environment variable.

<p class="level1">For instance, there are scripts for Tcl/Tk and Gtk which can be used to demonstrate the feature. When using Gtk, there is a limitation of that toolkit which requires that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>'s <span Class="bold">allowSendEvents</span> resource is enabled. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-j</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should do jump scrolling. It corresponds to the <span Class="bold">jumpScroll</span> resource. Normally, text is scrolled one line at a time; this option allows <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to move multiple lines at a time so that it does not fall as far behind. Its use is strongly recommended since it makes <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> much faster when scanning through large amounts of text. The VT100 escape sequences for enabling and disabling smooth scroll as well as the *(``VT Options*('' menu can be used to turn this feature on or off. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+j</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not do jump scrolling. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-k8</span> This option sets the <span Class="bold">allowC1Printable</span> resource. When <span Class="bold">allowC1Printable</span> is set, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> overrides the mapping of C1 control characters (code 128-159) to treat them as printable. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+k8</span> This option resets the <span Class="bold">allowC1Printable</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-kt  keyboardtype</span> This option sets the <span Class="bold">keyboardType</span> resource. Possible values include: *(``unknown*('', *(``default*('', *(``hp*('', *(``sco*('', *(``sun*('', *(``tcap*('' and *(``vt220*(''. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The value *(``unknown*('', causes the corresponding resource to be ignored. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span>

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-l</span> Turn logging on. Normally logging is not supported, due to security concerns. Some versions of <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> may have logging enabled. The logfile is written to the directory from which <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is invoked. The filename is generated, of the form 
<p class="level1">	XtermLog.<span Class="emphasis">XXXXXX</span> 
<p class="level1">or 
<p class="level1">	Xterm.log.<span Class="emphasis">hostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX</span>

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+l</span> Turn logging off. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-lc</span> Turn on support of various encodings according to the users' locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables. This is achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by invoking <span Class="emphasis">luit</span> for conversion between locale encodings and UTF-8. (<span Class="emphasis">luit</span> is not invoked in UTF-8 locales.) This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">locale</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The actual list of encodings which are supported is determined by <span Class="emphasis">luit</span>. Consult the <span Class="emphasis">luit</span> manual page for further details.

<p class="level1">See also the discussion of the <span Class="bold">-u8</span> option which supports UTF-8 locales. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+lc</span> Turn off support of automatic selection of locale encodings. Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8 locales or with <span Class="bold">-u8</span> option, UTF-8 mode will be used. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-lcc  path</span> File name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings and UTF-8 which is used with <span Class="bold">-lc</span> option or <span Class="bold">locale</span> resource. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">localeFilter</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-leftbar</span> Force scrollbar to the left side of VT100 screen. This is the default, unless you have set the rightScrollBar resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-lf  filename</span> Specify the log-filename. See the <span Class="bold">-l</span> option. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ls</span> This option indicates that the shell that is started in the <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> window will be a login shell (i.e., the first character of argv[0] will be a dash, indicating to the shell that it should read the user's .login or .profile). 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="bold">-ls</span> flag and the <span Class="bold">loginShell</span> resource are ignored if <span Class="bold">-e</span> is also given, because <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> does not know how to make the shell start the given command after whatever it does when it is a login shell - the user's shell of choice need not be a Bourne shell after all. Also, <span Class="emphasis">*n&nbsp;-e</span> is supposed to provide a consistent functionality for other applications that need to start text-mode programs in a window, and if <span Class="bold">loginShell</span> were not ignored, the result of ~/.profile might interfere with that. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If you do want the effect of <span Class="bold">-ls</span> and <span Class="bold">-e</span> simultaneously, you may get away with something like 
<p class="level1">*n -e /bin/bash -l -c "my command here" 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">Finally, <span Class="bold">-ls</span> is not completely ignored, because <span Class="emphasis">*n&nbsp;-ls&nbsp;-e</span> does write a <span Class="emphasis">/var/log/wtmp</span> entry (if configured to do so), whereas <span Class="emphasis">*n&nbsp;-e</span> does not. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-maximized</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should ask the window manager to maximize its layout on startup. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">maximized</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">Maximizing is not the reverse of iconifying; it is possible to do both with certain window managers. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+maximized</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should ask the window manager to not maximize its layout on startup. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+ls</span> This option indicates that the shell that is started should not be a login shell (i.e., it will be a normal *(``subshell*(''). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-mb</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should ring a margin bell when the user types near the right end of a line. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+mb</span> This option indicates that margin bell should not be rung. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-mc  milliseconds</span> This option specifies the maximum time between multi-click selections. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-mesg</span> Turn off the <span Class="bold">messages</span> resource, i.e., disallow write access to the terminal. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+mesg</span> Turn on the <span Class="bold">messages</span> resource, i.e., allow write access to the terminal. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-mk_width</span> Set the <span Class="bold">mkWidth</span> resource to *(``true*(''. This makes <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> use a built-in version of the wide-character width calculation. The default is *(``false*('' 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+mk_width</span> Reset the <span Class="bold">mkWidth</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ms  color</span> This option specifies the color to be used for the pointer cursor. The default is to use the foreground color. This sets the <span Class="emphasis">pointerColor</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-nb  number</span> This option specifies the number of characters from the right end of a line at which the margin bell, if enabled, will ring. The default is *(``10*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-nul</span> This option disables the display of underlining. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+nul</span> This option enables the display of underlining. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-pc</span> This option enables the PC-style use of bold colors (see boldColors resource). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+pc</span> This option disables the PC-style use of bold colors. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-pob</span> This option indicates that the window should be raised whenever a Control-G is received. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+pob</span> This option indicates that the window should not be raised whenever a Control-G is received. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-report-colors</span> Print a report to the standard output showing information about colors as <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> allocates them. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">reportColors</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-report-fonts</span> Print a report to the standard output showing information about fonts which are loaded. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">reportFonts</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-rightbar</span> Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100 screen. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-rvc</span> This option disables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+rvc</span> This option enables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-rw</span> This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should be allowed. This allows the cursor to back up from the leftmost column of one line to the rightmost column of the previous line. This is very useful for editing long shell command lines and is encouraged. This option can be turned on and off from the *(``VT Options*('' menu. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+rw</span> This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should not be allowed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-s</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> may scroll asynchronously, meaning that the screen does not have to be kept completely up to date while scrolling. This allows <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to run faster when network latencies are very high and is typically useful when running across a very large internet or many gateways. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+s</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should scroll synchronously. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-samename</span> Does not send title and icon name change requests when the request would have no effect: the name is not changed. This has the advantage of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra round trip to the server to find out the previous value. In practice this should never be a problem. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+samename</span> Always send title and icon name change requests. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-sb</span> This option indicates that some number of lines that are scrolled off the top of the window should be saved and that a scrollbar should be displayed so that those lines can be viewed. This option may be turned on and off from the *(``VT Options*('' menu. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+sb</span> This option indicates that a scrollbar should not be displayed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-selbg  color</span> This option specifies the color to use for the background of selected text. If not specified, reverse video is used. See the discussion of the <span Class="bold">highlightColor</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-selfg  color</span> This option specifies the color to use for selected text. If not specified, reverse video is used. See the discussion of the <span Class="bold">highlightTextColor</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-sf</span> This option indicates that Sun Function Key escape codes should be generated for function keys. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+sf</span> This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for function keys. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-sh  number</span> scale line-height values by the given number. See the discussion of the <span Class="bold">scaleHeight</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-si</span> This option indicates that output to a window should not automatically reposition the screen to the bottom of the scrolling region. This option can be turned on and off from the *(``VT Options*('' menu. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+si</span> This option indicates that output to a window should cause it to scroll to the bottom. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-sk</span> This option indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar to review previous lines of text should cause the window to be repositioned automatically in the normal position at the bottom of the scroll region. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+sk</span> This option indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar should not cause the window to be repositioned. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-sl  number</span> This option specifies the number of lines to save that have been scrolled off the top of the screen. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">saveLines</span> resource. The default is *(``64*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-sm</span> This option, corresponding to the <span Class="bold">sessionMgt</span> resource, indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should set up session manager callbacks. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+sm</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not set up session manager callbacks. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-sp</span> This option indicates that Sun/PC keyboard should be assumed, providing mapping for keypad *(``+' to *(``,', and CTRL-F1 to F13, CTRL-F2 to F14, etc. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+sp</span> This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for keypad and function keys. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-t</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should start in Tektronix mode, rather than in VT102 mode. Switching between the two windows is done using the *(``Options*('' menus. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">Terminal database (<span Class="emphasis">terminfo</span> (5) or <span Class="emphasis">termcap</span> (5)) entries that work with <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> are:

<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> automatically searches the terminal database in this order for these entries and then sets the *(``TERM*('' and the *(``TERMCAP*('' environment variables. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+t</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should start in VT102 mode. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-tb</span> This option, corresponding to the <span Class="bold">toolBar</span> resource, indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should display a toolbar (or menubar) at the top of its window. The buttons in the toolbar correspond to the popup menus, e.g., control/left/mouse for *(``Main Options*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+tb</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not set up a toolbar. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ti  term_id</span> Specify the name used by <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to select the correct response to terminal ID queries. It also specifies the emulation level, used to determine the type of response to a DA control sequence. Valid values include vt52, vt100, vt101, vt102, vt220, and vt240 (the *(``vt*('' is optional). The default is *(``vt420*(''. The term_id argument specifies the terminal ID to use. (This is the same as the <span Class="bold">decTerminalID</span> resource). 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-tm  string</span> This option specifies a series of terminal setting keywords followed by the characters that should be bound to those functions, similar to the <span Class="emphasis">stty</span> program. The keywords and their values are described in detail in the <span Class="bold">ttyModes</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-tn  name</span> This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the TERM environment variable. It corresponds to the <span Class="bold">termName</span> resource. This terminal type must exist in the terminal database (termcap or terminfo, depending on how <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is built) and should have <span Class="emphasis">li&#35;</span> and <span Class="emphasis">co&#35;</span> entries. If the terminal type is not found, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> uses the built-in list *(``xterm*('', *(``vt102*('', etc. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-u8</span> This option sets the <span Class="bold">utf8</span> resource. When <span Class="bold">utf8</span> is set, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> interprets incoming data as UTF-8. This sets the <span Class="bold">wideChars</span> resource as a side-effect, but the UTF-8 mode set by this option prevents it from being turned off. If you must turn UTF-8 encoding on and off, use the <span Class="bold">-wc</span> option or the corresponding <span Class="bold">wideChars</span> resource, rather than the <span Class="bold">-u8</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">This option and the <span Class="bold">utf8</span> resource are overridden by the <span Class="bold">-lc</span> and <span Class="bold">-en</span> options and <span Class="bold">locale</span> resource. That is, if <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> has been compiled to support <span Class="emphasis">luit</span>, and the <span Class="bold">locale</span> resource is not *(``false*('' this option is ignored. We recommend using the <span Class="bold">-lc</span> option or the *(``<span Class="bold">locale:&nbsp;true</span>*('' resource in UTF-8 locales when your operating system supports locale, or <span Class="bold">-en&nbsp;UTF-8</span> option or the *(``<span Class="bold">locale:&nbsp;UTF-8</span>*('' resource when your operating system does not support locale. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+u8</span> This option resets the <span Class="bold">utf8</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-uc</span> This option makes the cursor underlined instead of a box. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+uc</span> This option makes the cursor a box instead of underlined. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ulc</span> This option disables the display of characters with underline attribute as color rather than with underlining. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+ulc</span> This option enables the display of characters with underline attribute as color rather than with underlining. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ulit</span> This option, corresponding to the <span Class="bold">italicULMode</span> resource, disables the display of characters with underline attribute as italics rather than with underlining. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+ulit</span> This option, corresponding to the <span Class="bold">italicULMode</span> resource, enables the display of characters with underline attribute as italics rather than with underlining. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ut</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not write a record into the the system <span Class="emphasis">utmp</span> log file. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+ut</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should write a record into the system <span Class="emphasis">utmp</span> log file. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-vb</span> This option indicates that a visual bell is preferred over an audible one. Instead of ringing the terminal bell whenever a Control-G is received, the window will be flashed. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+vb</span> This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-wc</span> This option sets the <span Class="bold">wideChars</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">When <span Class="bold">wideChars</span> is set, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> maintains internal structures for 16-bit characters. If <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is not started in UTF-8 mode (or if this resource is not set), initially it maintains those structures to support 8-bit characters. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span> can later be switched, using a menu entry or control sequence, causing it to reallocate those structures to support 16-bit characters. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The default is *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+wc</span> This option resets the <span Class="bold">wideChars</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-wf</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should wait for the window to be mapped the first time before starting the subprocess so that the initial terminal size settings and environment variables are correct. It is the application's responsibility to catch subsequent terminal size changes. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">+wf</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should not wait before starting the subprocess. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-ziconbeep percent</span> Same as <span Class="bold">zIconBeep</span> resource. If percent is non-zero, xterms that produce output while iconified will cause an XBell sound at the given volume and have *(``****('' prepended to their icon titles. Most window managers will detect this change immediately, showing you which window has the output. (A similar feature was in x10 <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>.) 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-C</span> This option indicates that this window should receive console output. This is not supported on all systems. To obtain console output, you must be the owner of the console device, and you must have read and write permission for it. If you are running X under <span Class="emphasis">xdm</span> on the console screen you may need to have the session startup and reset programs explicitly change the ownership of the console device in order to get this option to work. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">-Sccn</span> This option allows <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to be used as an input and output channel for an existing program and is sometimes used in specialized applications. The option value specifies the last few letters of the name of a pseudo-terminal to use in slave mode, plus the number of the inherited file descriptor. If the option contains a *(``/*('' character, that delimits the characters used for the pseudo-terminal name from the file descriptor. Otherwise, exactly two characters are used from the option for the pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor.

This is part of the <span Class="bold">ptyHandshake</span> logic. When <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is directed to wait in this fashion, it passes the terminal size from the display end of the pseudo-terminal to the terminal I/O connection, e.g., according to the window manager.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">activeIcon (class\fB ActiveIcon)</span> Specifies whether or not active icon windows are to be used when the <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> window is iconified, if this feature is compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. The active icon is a miniature representation of the content of the window and will update as the content changes. Not all window managers necessarily support application icon windows.

Formatting characters (tab, newline) are always allowed. Other C0 control characters are suppressed unless this resource is enabled.

<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">When this feature is enabled, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will sense the state of the Scroll Lock key each time it acquires focus. Pressing the Scroll Lock key toggles <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>'s internal state, as well as toggling the associated LED. While the Scroll Lock is active, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> attempts to keep a viewport on the same set of lines.

<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The reason for setting the default to *(``false*('' is to avoid user surprise. This key is generally unused in keyboard configurations, and has not acquired a standard meaning even when it is used in that manner. Consequently, users have assigned it for ad hoc purposes. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">allowSendEvents (class\fB AllowSendEvents)</span> Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events (generated using the X protocol SendEvent request) should be interpreted or discarded.

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">allowTcapOps (class\fB AllowTcapOps)</span> Specifies whether control sequences that query the terminal's notion of its function-key strings, as termcap or terminfo capabilities should be allowed. The default is *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">A few programs, e.g., <span Class="emphasis">vim</span>, use this feature to get an accurate description of the terminal's capabilities, independent of the termcap/terminfo setting:

<p class="level2"><span Class="emphasis">*n</span> can tell the querying program what strings are sent by modified (shift-, control-, alt-) function- and keypad-keys. Reporting control- and alt-modifiers is a feature that relies on the <span Class="emphasis">ncurses</span> extended naming.

<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">Note that the <span Class="emphasis">Alt</span> key is not necessarily the same as the <span Class="emphasis">Meta</span> modifier. <span Class="emphasis">xmodmap</span> lists your key modifiers.

Interestingly enough, <span Class="emphasis">bash</span>'s notion of "meta mode" differs from the standard definition (in the <span Class="emphasis">terminfo</span> manual), which describes the change to the eighth bit of a character. It happens that <span Class="emphasis">bash</span> views "meta mode" as the ESC character that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> puts before a character when a special meta key is pressed. <span Class="emphasis">bash</span>'s early documentation talks about the ESC character and ignores the eighth bit.

The default is *(``false*('', which tells it to use PRIMARY. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">shiftFonts (class\fB ShiftFonts)</span> Specifies whether to enable the actions <span Class="bold">larger-vt-font()</span> and <span Class="bold">smaller-vt-font()</span>, which are normally bound to the shifted KP_Add and KP_Subtract. The default is *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">showBlinkAsBold (class\fB ShowBlinkAsBold)</span> Tells <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> whether to display text with blink-attribute the same as bold.

This is only in effect if <span Class="bold">titeInhibit</span> is *(``true*('', because the intent of this option is to provide a picture of the full-screen application's display on the scrollback without wiping out the text that would be shown before the application was initialized. The default for this resource is *(``false*(''.

If set, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> also ignores the escape sequence to switch to the alternate screen. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span> supports terminfo in a different way, supporting composite control sequences (also known as private modes) 1047, 1048 and 1049 which have the same effect as the original 47 control sequence. The default for this resource is *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">titleModes (class\fB TitleModes)</span> Tells <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> whether to accept or return window- and icon-labels in ISO-8859-1 (the default) or UTF-8. Either can be encoded in hexadecimal. The default for this resource is *(``0*(''.

See the <a class="bold" href="#ACTIONS">ACTIONS</a> section. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">trimSelection (class\fB TrimSelection)</span> If you set <span Class="bold">highlightSelection</span>, you can see the text which is selected, including any trailing spaces. Clearing the screen (or a line) resets it to a state containing no spaces. Some lines may contain trailing spaces when an application writes them to the screen. However, you may not wish to paste lines with trailing spaces. If this resource is true, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will trim trailing spaces from text which is selected. It does not affect spaces which result in a wrapped line, nor will it trim the trailing newline from your selection. The default is *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">underLine (class\fB UnderLine)</span> This specifies whether or not text with the underline attribute should be underlined. It may be desirable to disable underlining when color is being used for the underline attribute. The default is *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">useClipping (class\fB UseClipping)</span> Tell <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> whether to use clipping to keep from producing dots outside the text drawing area. Originally used to work around for overstriking effects, this is also needed to work with some incorrectly-sized fonts. The default is *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">utf8 (class\fB Utf8)</span> This specifies whether <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will run in UTF-8 mode. If you set this resource, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> also sets the <span Class="bold">wideChars</span> resource as a side-effect. The resource can be set via the menu entry *(``UTF-8 Encoding*(''. The default is *(``default*(''.

The default is *(``false*(''. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">utf8SelectTypes (class\fB Utf8SelectTypes)</span> Override <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>'s default selection target list (see SELECT/PASTE) for selections in wide-character (UTF-8) mode. The default is an empty string, i.e., *(``*('', which does not override anything. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">utf8Title (class\fB Utf8Title)</span> Applications can set <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>'s title by writing a control sequence. Normally this control sequence follows the VT220 convention, which encodes the string in ISO-8859-1 and allows for an 8-bit string terminator. If <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is started in a UTF-8 locale, it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8 to work with the X libraries which assume the string is UTF-8. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">However, some users may wish to write a title string encoded in UTF-8. The window manager is responsible for drawing window titles. Some window managers (not all) support UTF-8 encoding of window titles. Set this resource to *(``true*('' to allow UTF-8 encoded title strings. That cancels the translation to UTF-8, allowing UTF-8 strings to be displayed as is.

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">visualBellDelay (class\fB VisualBellDelay)</span> Number of milliseconds to delay when displaying a visual bell. Default is 100. If set to zero, no visual bell is displayed. This is useful for very slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on a laptop. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">visualBellLine (class\fB VisualBellLine)</span> Specifies whether to flash only the current line when displaying a visual bell. rather than flashing the entire screen: The default is *(``false*('', which tells <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to flash the entire screen. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">vt100Graphics (class\fB VT100Graphics)</span> This specifies whether <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will interpret VT100 graphic character escape sequences while in UTF-8 mode. The default is *(``true*('', to provide support for various legacy applications. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">wideBoldFont (class\fB WideBoldFont)</span> This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text. By default, it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text. If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the bold font. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">wideChars (class\fB WideChars)</span> Specifies if <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> should respond to control sequences that process 16-bit characters. The default is *(``false*(''.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The following resources are useful when specified for the Athena Scrollbar widget: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">thickness (class\fB Thickness)</span> Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">background (class\fB Background)</span> Specifies the color to use for the background of the scrollbar. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">foreground (class\fB Foreground)</span> Specifies the color to use for the foreground of the scrollbar. The *(``thumb*('' of the scrollbar is a simple checkerboard pattern alternating pixels for foreground and background color. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="POINTER"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">POINTER USAGE</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Once the VT102 window is created, <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> allows you to select text and copy it within the same or other windows. 
<p class="level0"><a name="SELECTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SELECTION</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The selection functions are invoked when the pointer buttons are used with no modifiers, and when they are used with the *(``shift*('' key. The assignment of the functions described below to keys and buttons may be changed through the resource database; see <a class="bold" href="#ACTIONS">ACTIONS</a> below. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Pointer button one (usually left) is used to save text into the cut buffer. Move the cursor to beginning of the text, and then hold the button down while moving the cursor to the end of the region and releasing the button. The selected text is highlighted and is saved in the global cut buffer and made the PRIMARY selection when the button is released. Normally (but see the discussion of <span Class="bold">on2Clicks</span>, etc): 
<p class="level0">Double-clicking selects by words. 
<p class="level0">Triple-clicking selects by lines. 
<p class="level0">Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc. 
<p class="level0">Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up to button down, so you can change the selection unit in the middle of a selection. Logical words and lines selected by double- or triple-clicking may wrap across more than one screen line if lines were wrapped by <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> itself rather than by the application running in the window. If the key/button bindings specify that an X selection is to be made, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will leave the selected text highlighted for as long as it is the selection owner. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Pointer button two (usually middle) *(``types*('' (pastes) the text from the PRIMARY selection, if any, otherwise from the cut buffer, inserting it as keyboard input. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Pointer button three (usually right) extends the current selection. (Without loss of generality, you can swap *(``right*('' and *(``left*('' everywhere in the rest of this paragraph.)  If pressed while closer to the right edge of the selection than the left, it extends/contracts the right edge of the selection. If you contract the selection past the left edge of the selection, <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> assumes you really meant the left edge, restores the original selection, then extends/contracts the left edge of the selection. Extension starts in the selection unit mode that the last selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click to cycle through them. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines, you can take text from several places in different windows and form a command to the shell, for example, or take output from a program and insert it into your favorite editor. Since cut buffers are globally shared among different applications, you may regard each as a *(``file*('' whose contents you know. The terminal emulator and other text programs should be treating it as if it were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines. 
<p class="level0"><a name="SCROLLING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SCROLLING</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently showing in the window (highlighted) relative to the amount of text actually saved. As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of the highlighted area decreases. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region moves the adjacent line to the top of the display window. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Clicking button three moves the top line of the display window down to the pointer position. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Clicking button two moves the display to a position in the saved text that corresponds to the pointer's position in the scrollbar. 
<p class="level0"><a name="TEKTRONIX"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">TEKTRONIX POINTER</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Unlike the VT102 window, the Tektronix window does not allow the copying of text. It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode the cursor will change from an arrow to a cross. Pressing any key will send that key and the current coordinate of the cross cursor. Pressing button one, two, or three will return the letters *(``l*('', *(``m*('', and *(``r*('', respectively. If the *(``shift*('' key is pressed when a pointer button is pressed, the corresponding upper case letter is sent. To distinguish a pointer button from a key, the high bit of the character is set (but this is bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW; see <span Class="emphasis">tty (4)</span> for details). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="SELECTPASTE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SELECT/PASTE</h2>
<p class="level0">X clients provide select and paste support by responding to requests conveyed by the server. <a name="PRIMARY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">PRIMARY</h2>
<p class="level0">When configured to use the primary selection, (the default) <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> can provide the selection data in ways which help to retain character encoding information as it is pasted. 
<p class="level0">A user *(``selects*('' text on *n, which highlights the selected text. A subsequent *(``paste*('' to another client forwards a request to the client owning the selection. If <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> owns the primary selection, it makes the data available in the form of one or more *(``selection targets*(''. If it does not own the primary selection, e.g., if it has released it or another client has asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers to pass the data. But cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data (officially - some clients ignore the rules). 
<p class="level0"><a name="CLIPBOARD"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CLIPBOARD</h2>
<p class="level0">When configured to use the clipboard (see resource <span Class="bold">selectToClipboard</span>), the problem with persistence of ownership is bypassed. Otherwise, there is no difference regarding the data which can be passed via selection. 
<p class="level0">The PRIMARY token is a standard X feature, documented in the ICCCM (<span Class="emphasis">Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</span>), which states 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">The selection named by the atom PRIMARY is used for all commands that take only a single argument and is the principal means of communication between clients that use the selection mechanism.  
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">However, many applications use CLIPBOARD in imitation of other windowing systems. The <span Class="bold">selectToClipboard</span> resource (and corresponding menu entry <span Class="emphasis">Select to Clipboard</span>) introduce the SELECT token (known only to <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>) which chooses between the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD tokens. 
<p class="level0">Without using this feature, one can use workarounds such as the <span Class="emphasis">xclip</span> program to show the contents of the X clipboard within an <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> window. 
<p class="level0"><a name="SELECTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SELECTION TARGETS</h2>
<p class="level0">The different types of data which are passed depend on what the receiving client asks for. These are termed <span Class="emphasis">selection targets</span>. 
<p class="level0">When asking for the selection data, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> tries the following types in this order: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">UTF8_STRING This is an XFree86 extension, which denotes that the data is encoded in UTF-8. When <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is built with wide-character support, it both accepts and provides this type. 
<p class="level1">TEXT the text is in the encoding which corresponds to your current locale. 
<p class="level1">COMPOUND_TEXT this is a format for multiple character set data, such as multi-lingual text. It can store UTF-8 data as a special case. 
<p class="level1">STRING This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> is configured with the <span Class="bold">i18nSelections</span> resource set to *(``true*(''. 
<p class="level0">UTF8_STRING is preferred (therefore first in the list) since <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> stores text as Unicode data when running in wide-character mode, and no translation is needed. On the other hand, TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT may require translation. If the translation is incomplete, they will insert X's *(``defaultString*('' whose value cannot be set, and may simply be empty. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span>'s <span Class="bold">defaultString</span> resource specifies the string to use for incomplete translations of the UTF8_STRING. 
<p class="level0">You can alter the types which <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> tries using the <span Class="bold">eightBitSelectTypes</span> or <span Class="bold">utf8SelectTypes</span> resources. For instance, you might have some specific locale setting which does not use UTF-8 encoding. The resource value is a comma-separated list of the selection targets, which consist of the names shown. You can use the special name I18N to denote the optional inclusion of TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT. The names are matched ignoring case, and can be abbreviated. The default list can be expressed in several ways, e.g., 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1"><pre class="level1">
UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING
utf8,i18n,string
u,i,s
</pre>

<p class="level0"><a name="MENUS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">MENUS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">*N</span> has four menus, named <span Class="emphasis">mainMenu ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">vtMenu ,</span> <span Class="emphasis">fontMenu ,</span> and <span Class="emphasis">tekMenu .</span> Each menu pops up under the correct combinations of key and button presses. Each menu is divided into sections, separated by a horizontal line. Some menu entries correspond to modes that can be altered. A check mark appears next to a mode that is currently active. Selecting one of these modes toggles its state. Other menu entries are commands; selecting one of these performs the indicated function. 
<p class="level0">All of the menu entries correspond to X actions. In the list below, the menu label is shown followed by the action's name in parenthesis. 
<p class="level0"><a name="Main"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Main Options</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> <span Class="emphasis">mainMenu</span> pops up when the *(``control*('' key and pointer button one are pressed in a window. This menu contains items that apply to both the VT102 and Tektronix windows. There are several sections: 
<p class="level0">Commands for managing X events: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Toolbar Clicking on the *(``Toolbar*('' menu entry hides the toolbar if it is visible, and shows it if it is not. 
<p class="level1">Secure Keyboard (securekbd) The <span Class="bold">Secure Keyboard</span> mode is helpful when typing in passwords or other sensitive data in an unsecure environment; see <a class="bold" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a> below (but read the limitations carefully). 
<p class="level1">Allow SendEvents (allowsends) Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events generated using the X protocol SendEvent request should be interpreted or discarded. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">allowSendEvents</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Redraw Window (redraw) Forces the X display to repaint; useful in some environments. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Commands for capturing output: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Log to File (logging) Captures text sent to the screen in a logfile, as in the <span Class="bold">-l</span> logging option. 
<p class="level1">Print-All Immediately Invokes the <span Class="bold">print-immediate</span> action, sending the text of the current window directly to a file, as specified by the <span Class="bold">printFileImmediate</span>, <span Class="bold">printModeImmediate</span> and <span Class="bold">printOptsImmediate</span> resources. 
<p class="level1">Print-All on Error Invokes the <span Class="bold">print-on-error</span> action, which toggles a flag telling <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> that if it exits with an X error, to send the text of the current window directly to a file, as specified by the <span Class="bold">printFileXError</span>, <span Class="bold">printModeXError</span> and <span Class="bold">printOptsXError</span> resources. 
<p class="level1">Print Window (print) Sends the text of the current window to the program given in the <span Class="bold">printerCommand</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Redirect to Printer (print-redir) This sets the <span Class="bold">printerControlMode</span> to 0 or 2. You can use this to turn the printer on as if an application had sent the appropriate control sequence. It is also useful for switching the printer off if an application turns it on without resetting the print control mode. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Modes for setting keyboard style: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">8-Bit Controls (8-bit-control) Enabled for VT220 emulation, this controls whether <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will send 8-bit control sequences rather than using 7-bit (ASCII) controls, e.g., sending a byte in the range 128-159 rather than the escape character followed by a second byte. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span> always interprets both 8-bit and 7-bit control sequences (see the document <span Class="emphasis">Xterm Control Sequences</span>). This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">eightBitControl</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Backarrow Key (BS/DEL) (backarrow&nbsp;key) Modifies the behavior of the backarrow key, making it transmit either a backspace (8) or delete (127) character. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">backarrowKey</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Alt/NumLock Modifiers (num-lock) Controls the treatment of Alt- and NumLock-key modifiers. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">numLock</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Meta Sends Escape (meta-esc) Controls whether <span Class="emphasis">Meta</span> keys are converted into a two-character sequence with the character itself preceded by ESC. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">metaSendsEscape</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Delete is DEL (delete-is-del) Controls whether the Delete key on the editing keypad should send DEL (127) or the VT220-style Remove escape sequence. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">deleteIsDEL</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Old Function-Keys (oldFunctionKeys) 
<p class="level1">HP Function-Keys (hpFunctionKeys) 
<p class="level1">SCO Function-Keys (scoFunctionKeys) 
<p class="level1">Sun Function-Keys (sunFunctionKeys)

<p class="level1">Send STOP Signal (suspend) 
<p class="level1">Send CONT Signal (continue) 
<p class="level1">Send INT Signal (interrupt) 
<p class="level1">Send HUP Signal (hangup) 
<p class="level1">Send TERM Signal (terminate) 
<p class="level1">Send KILL Signal (kill) These send the SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals respectively, to the process group of the process running under <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> (usually the shell). The <span Class="bold">SIGCONT</span> function is especially useful if the user has accidentally typed CTRL-Z, suspending the process.

<p class="level1">Enable Pop on Bell (poponbell) Enable (or disable) raising of the window when Control-G is received. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">-pop</span> option and the <span Class="bold">popOnBell</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Enable Blinking Cursor (cursorblink) Enable (or disable) the blinking-cursor feature. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">-bc</span> option and the <span Class="bold">cursorBlink</span> resource. There is also an escape sequence (see the document <span Class="emphasis">Xterm Control Sequences</span>). The menu entry and the escape sequence states are XOR'd: if both are enabled, the cursor will not blink, if only one is enabled, the cursor will blink. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Enable Alternate Screen Switching (titeInhibit) Enable (or disable) switching between the normal and alternate screens. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">titeInhibit</span> resource. There is no corresponding command-line option. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Enable Active Icon (activeicon) Enable (or disable) the active-icon feature. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">-ai</span> option and the <span Class="bold">activeIcon</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Sixel Scrolling (sixelScrolling) When enabled, sixel graphics are positioned at the current text cursor location, scroll the image vertically if larger than the screen, and leave the text cursor at the start of the next complete line after the image when returning to text mode (this is the default). When disabled, sixel graphics are positioned at the upper left of the screen, are cropped to fit the screen, and do not affect the text cursor location. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">sixelScrolling</span> resource. There is no corresponding command-line option. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Private Color Registers (privateColorRegisters) When enabled, each graphic image uses a separate set of color registers, so that it essentially has a private palette (this is the default).  If it is not set, all graphics images share a common set of registers which is how sixel and ReGIS graphics worked on actual hardware.  The default is likely a more useful mode on modern TrueColor hardware. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">privateColorRegisters</span> resource. There is no corresponding command-line option.

<p class="level1">Do Soft Reset (softreset) Reset scroll regions. This can be convenient when some program has left the scroll regions set incorrectly (often a problem when using VMS or TOPS-20). This corresponds to the VT220 DECSTR control sequence. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Do Full Reset (hardreset) The full reset entry will clear the screen, reset tabs to every eight columns, and reset the terminal modes (such as wrap and smooth scroll) to their initial states just after <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> has finished processing the command line options. This corresponds to the VT102 RIS control sequence, with a few obvious differences. For example, your session is not disconnected as a real VT102 would do.

<p class="level1">Selection (fontsel) This allows you to set the font specified the current selection as a font name (if the PRIMARY selection is owned). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The second section allows you to modify the way it is displayed: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Bold Fonts This is normally checked (enabled). When unchecked, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> will not use bold fonts. The setting corresponds to the <span Class="bold">allowBoldFonts</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Line-Drawing Characters (font-linedrawing) When set, tells <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to draw its own line-drawing characters. Otherwise it relies on the font containing these. Compare to the <span Class="bold">forceBoxChars</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Packed Font (font-packed) When set, tells <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to use the minimum glyph-width from a font when displaying characters. Use the maximum width (unchecked) to help display proportional fonts. Compare to the <span Class="bold">forcePackedFont</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">Doublesized Characters (font-doublesize) When set, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> may ask the font server to produce scaled versions of the normal font, for VT102 double-size characters.

<p class="level1">UTF-8 Encoding (utf8-mode) This controls whether <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> uses UTF-8 encoding of input/output. It is useful for temporarily switching <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to display text from an application which does not follow the locale settings. It corresponds to the <span Class="bold">utf8</span> resource. 
<p class="level1">UTF-8 Fonts (utf8-fonts) This controls whether <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> uses UTF-8 fonts for display. It is useful for temporarily switching <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to display text from an application which does not follow the locale settings. It combines the <span Class="bold">utf8</span> and <span Class="bold">utf8Fonts</span> resources. 
<p class="level1">UTF-8 Titles (utf8-titles) This controls whether <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> accepts UTF-8 encoding for title control sequences. It corresponds to the <span Class="bold">utf8Fonts</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">Initially the checkmark is set according to both the <span Class="bold">utf8</span> and <span Class="bold">utf8Fonts</span> resource values.

<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The standard <span Class="bold">XTerm</span> app-defaults file defines both sets of fonts, while the <span Class="bold">UXTerm</span> app-defaults file defines only one set. assuming the standard app-defaults files, this command will launch <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> able to switch between UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoded fonts:

<p class="level2">Allow Color Ops (allow-font-ops) This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">allowColorOps</span> resource. Enable or disable control sequences that set/query the colors. 
<p class="level2">Allow Font Ops (allow-font-ops) This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">allowFontOps</span> resource. Enable or disable control sequences that set/query the font. 
<p class="level2">Allow Tcap Ops (allow-tcap-ops) Enable or disable control sequences that query the terminal's notion of its function-key strings, as termcap or terminfo capabilities. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">allowTcapOps</span> resource. 
<p class="level2">Allow Title Ops (allow-title-ops) Enable or disable control sequences that modify the window title or icon name. This corresponds to the <span Class="bold">allowTitleOps</span> resource.

<p class="level0"><a name="SECURITY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SECURITY</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">X environments differ in their security consciousness. 
<p class="level0">Most servers, run under <span Class="emphasis">xdm</span>, are capable of using a *(``magic cookie*('' authorization scheme that can provide a reasonable level of security for many people. If your server is only using a host-based mechanism to control access to the server (see <span Class="emphasis">xhost(1)</span>), then if you enable access for a host and other users are also permitted to run clients on that same host, it is possible that someone can run an application which uses the basic services of the X protocol to snoop on your activities, potentially capturing a transcript of everything you type at the keyboard. 
<p class="level0">Any process which has access to your X display can manipulate it in ways that you might not anticipate, even redirecting your keyboard to itself and sending events to your application's windows. This is true even with the *(``magic cookie*('' authorization scheme. While the <span Class="bold">allowSendEvents</span> provides some protection against rogue applications tampering with your programs, guarding against a snooper is harder. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The X input extension for instance allows an application to bypass all of the other (limited) authorization and security features, including the GrabKeyboard protocol. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The possibility of an application spying on your keystrokes is of particular concern when you want to type in a password or other sensitive data. The best solution to this problem is to use a better authorization mechanism than is provided by X. 
<p class="level0">Subject to all of these caveats, a simple mechanism exists for protecting keyboard input in <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> menu (see <a class="bold" href="#MENUS">MENUS</a> above) contains a <span Class="bold">Secure Keyboard</span> entry which, when enabled, attempts to ensure that all keyboard input is directed <span Class="emphasis">only</span> to <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request). When an application prompts you for a password (or other sensitive data), you can enable <span Class="bold">Secure Keyboard</span> using the menu, type in the data, and then disable <span Class="bold">Secure Keyboard</span> using the menu again. 
<p class="level0">This ensures that you know which window is accepting your keystrokes. 
<p class="level0">It cannot ensure that there are no processes which have access to your X display that might be observing the keystrokes as well. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard, so when you attempt to enable <span Class="bold">Secure Keyboard</span> it may fail. In this case, the bell will sound. If the <span Class="bold">Secure Keyboard</span> succeeds, the foreground and background colors will be exchanged (as if you selected the <span Class="bold">Reverse Video</span> entry in the <span Class="bold">Modes</span> menu); they will be exchanged again when you exit secure mode. If the colors do <span Class="emphasis">not</span> switch, then you should be <span Class="emphasis">very</span> suspicious that you are being spoofed. If the application you are running displays a prompt before asking for the password, it is safest to enter secure mode <span Class="emphasis">before</span> the prompt gets displayed, and to make sure that the prompt gets displayed correctly (in the new colors), to minimize the probability of spoofing. You can also bring up the menu again and make sure that a check mark appears next to the entry. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Secure Keyboard</span> mode will be disabled automatically if your <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> window becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up a reparenting window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration around the window) while in <span Class="bold">Secure Keyboard</span> mode. (This is a feature of the X protocol not easily overcome.)  When this happens, the foreground and background colors will be switched back and the bell will sound in warning. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="CHARACTER"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CHARACTER CLASSES</h2>
<p class="level0">Clicking the left pointer button twice in rapid succession (double-clicking) causes all characters of the same class (e.g., letters, white space, punctuation) to be selected as a *(``word*(''. Since different people have different preferences for what should be selected (for example, should filenames be selected as a whole or only the separate subnames), the default mapping can be overridden through the use of the <span Class="bold">charClass</span> (class <span Class="emphasis">CharClass</span>) resource. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This resource is a series of comma-separated of <span Class="emphasis">range</span>:<span Class="emphasis">value</span> pairs.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">allow-window-ops(on/off/toggle)</span> This action sets, unsets or toggles the <span Class="bold">allowWindowOps</span> resource and is also invoked by the <span Class="bold">allow-window-ops</span> entry in <span Class="emphasis">fontMenu</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">alt-sends-escape()</span> This action toggles the state of the <span Class="bold">altSendsEscape</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">bell([percent])</span> This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified percentage above or below the base volume. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">clear-saved-lines()</span> This action does <span Class="bold">hard-reset()</span> (see below) and also clears the history of lines saved off the top of the screen. It is also invoked from the <span Class="bold">clearsavedlines</span> entry in <span Class="emphasis">vtMenu</span>. The effect is identical to a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">copy-selection(destname [, ...])</span> This action puts the currently selected text into all of the selections or cutbuffers specified by <span Class="emphasis">destname</span>. Unlike <span Class="bold">select-end</span>, it does not send a mouse position or otherwise modify the internal selection state. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">create-menu(m/v/f/t)</span> This action creates one of the menus used by <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>, if it has not been previously created. The parameter values are the menu names: <span Class="emphasis">mainMenu</span>, <span Class="emphasis">vtMenu</span>, <span Class="emphasis">fontMenu</span>, <span Class="emphasis">tekMenu</span>, respectively. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dabbrev-expand()</span> Expands the word before cursor by searching in the preceding text on the screen and in the scrollback buffer for words starting with that abbreviation. Repeating <span Class="bold">dabbrev-expand()</span> several times in sequence searches for an alternative expansion by looking farther back. Lack of more matches is signaled by a <span Class="bold">beep()</span>. Attempts to expand an empty word (i.e., when cursor is preceded by a space) yield successively all previous words. Consecutive identical expansions are ignored. The word here is defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. This feature partially emulates the behavior of *(``dynamic abbreviation*('' expansion in Emacs (bound there to M-/). Here is a resource setting for <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> which will do the same thing: 
<p class="level0">*VT100*translations:    &#35;override \n\ &nbsp;       Meta &lt;KeyPress&gt; /:dabbrev-expand() 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">deiconify()</span> Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">delete-is-del()</span> This action toggles the state of the <span Class="bold">deleteIsDEL</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">dired-button()</span> Handles a button event (other than press and release) by echoing the event's position (i.e., character line and column) in the following format: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">^X ESC G &lt;line+*(`` *(''&gt; &lt;col+*(`` *(''&gt; 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">fullscreen(on/off/toggle)</span> This action sets, unsets or toggles the <span Class="bold">fullscreen</span> resource. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">iconify()</span> Iconifies the window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">hard-reset()</span> This action resets the scrolling region, tabs, window size, and cursor keys and clears the screen. It is also invoked from the <span Class="bold">hardreset</span> entry in <span Class="emphasis">vtMenu</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ignore()</span> This action ignores the event but checks for special pointer position escape sequences. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">insert()</span> This action inserts the character or string associated with the key that was pressed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">insert-eight-bit()</span> This action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the character or string associated with the key that was pressed. Only single-byte values are treated specially. The exact action depends on the value of the <span Class="bold">altSendsEscape</span> and the <span Class="bold">metaSendsEscape</span> and the <span Class="bold">eightBitInput</span> resources. The <span Class="bold">metaSendsEscape</span> resource is tested first. See the <span Class="bold">eightBitInput</span> resource for a full discussion. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The term *(``eight-bit*('' is misleading: <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> checks if the key is in the range 128 to 255 (the eighth bit is set). If the value is in that range, depending on the resource values, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> may then do one of the following: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">add 128 to the value, setting its eighth bit, 
<p class="level2">send an ESC byte before the key, or 
<p class="level2">send the key unaltered. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">exec-formatted(format, sourcename [, ...])</span> Execute an external command, using the current selection for part of the command's parameters. The first parameter, <span Class="emphasis">format</span> gives the basic command. Succeeding parameters specify the selection source as in <span Class="bold">insert-selection</span>. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The <span Class="emphasis">format</span> parameter allows these substitutions: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">%% inserts a "%". 
<p class="level2">%P the screen-position at the beginning of the highlighted region, as a semicolon-separated pair of integers using the values that the CUP control sequence would use. 
<p class="level2">%p the screen-position after the beginning of the highlighted region, using the same convention as *(``%P*(''. 
<p class="level2">%S the length of the string that *(``%s*('' would insert.

<p class="level2">%T the length of the string that *(``%t*('' would insert. 
<p class="level2">%t the selection, trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace, and newlines changed to single spaces. 
<p class="level2">%V the video attributes at the beginning of the highlighted region, as a semicolon-separated list of integers using the values that the SGR control sequence would use.

<p class="level1">After constructing the command-string, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> forks a subprocess and executes the command, which completes independently of *n. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">exec-selectable(format, onClicks)</span> Execute an external command, using data copied from the screen for part of the command's parameters. The first parameter, <span Class="emphasis">format</span> gives the basic command as in <span Class="bold">exec-formatted</span>. The second parameter specifies the method for copying the data as in the <span Class="bold">onClicks</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">insert-formatted(format, sourcename [, ...])</span> Insert the current selection or data related to it, formatted. The first parameter, <span Class="emphasis">format</span> gives the template for the data as in <span Class="bold">exec-formatted</span>. Succeeding parameters specify the selection source as in <span Class="bold">insert-selection</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">insert-selectable(format, onClicks)</span> Insert data copied from the screen, formatted. The first parameter, <span Class="emphasis">format</span> gives the template for the data as in <span Class="bold">exec-formatted</span>. The second parameter specifies the method for copying the data as in the <span Class="bold">onClicks</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">insert-selection(sourcename [, ...])</span> This action inserts the string found in the selection or cutbuffer indicated by <span Class="emphasis">sourcename</span>. Sources are checked in the order given (case is significant) until one is found. Commonly-used selections include: <a class="emphasis" href="#PRIMARY">PRIMARY</a>, <span Class="emphasis">SECONDARY</span>, and <a class="emphasis" href="#CLIPBOARD">CLIPBOARD</a>. Cut buffers are typically named <span Class="emphasis">CUT_BUFFER0</span> through <span Class="emphasis">CUT_BUFFER7</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">insert-seven-bit()</span> This action is a synonym for <span Class="bold">insert()</span> The term *(``seven-bit*('' is misleading: it only implies that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> does not try to add 128 to the key's value as in <span Class="bold">insert-eight-bit()</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">interpret(control-sequence)</span> Interpret the given control sequence locally, i.e., without passing it to the host. This works by inserting the control sequence at the front of the input buffer. Use *(``\*('' to escape octal digits in the string. Xt does not allow you to put a null character (i.e., *(``\000*('') in the string. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">keymap(name)</span> This action dynamically defines a new translation table whose resource name is <span Class="emphasis">name</span> with the suffix <span Class="emphasis">Keymap</span> (case is significant). The name <span Class="emphasis">None</span> restores the original translation table. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">larger-vt-font()</span> Set the font to the next larger one, based on the font dimensions. See also <span Class="bold">set-vt-font()</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">load-vt-fonts(name[,class])</span> Load fontnames from the given subresource name and class. That is, load the *(``*VT100.<span Class="emphasis">name</span>.font*('', resource as *(``*VT100.font*('' etc. If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">Unlike <span Class="bold">set-vt-font()</span>, this does not affect the escape- and select-fonts, since those are not based on resource values. It does affect the fonts loosely organized under the *(``Default*('' menu entry, including <span Class="bold">font</span>, <span Class="bold">boldFont</span>, <span Class="bold">wideFont</span> and <span Class="bold">wideBoldFont</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">maximize()</span> Resizes the window to fill the screen. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">meta-sends-escape()</span> This action toggles the state of the <span Class="bold">metaSendsEscape</span> resource. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">popup-menu(menuname)</span> This action displays the specified popup menu. Valid names (case is significant) include:  <span Class="emphasis">mainMenu</span>, <span Class="emphasis">vtMenu</span>, <span Class="emphasis">fontMenu</span>, and <span Class="emphasis">tekMenu</span>. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">print(printer-flags)</span> This action prints the window. It is also invoked by the <span Class="emphasis">print</span> entry in <span Class="emphasis">mainMenu</span>. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">The action accepts optional parameters, which temporarily override resource settings. The parameter values are matched ignoring case: 
<p class="level2">
<p class="level2">noFormFeed no form feed will be sent at the end of the last line printed (i.e., <span Class="bold">printerFormFeed</span> is ``false''). 
<p class="level2">FormFeed a form feed will be sent at the end of the last line printed (i.e., <span Class="bold">printerFormFeed</span> is ``true''). 
<p class="level2">noNewLine no newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed, and wrapped lines will be combined into long lines (i.e., <span Class="bold">printerNewLine</span> is ``false''). 
<p class="level2">NewLine a newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed, and each line will be limited (by adding a newline) to the screen width (i.e., <span Class="bold">printerNewLine</span> is ``true''). 
<p class="level2">noAttrs the page is printed without attributes (i.e., <span Class="bold">printAttributes</span> is ``0'').

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">print-immediate()</span> Sends the text of the current window directly to a file, as specified by the <span Class="bold">printFileImmediate</span>, <span Class="bold">printModeImmediate</span> and <span Class="bold">printOptsImmediate</span> resources. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">print-on-error()</span> Toggles a flag telling <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> that if it exits with an X error, to send the text of the current window directly to a file, as specified by the <span Class="bold">printFileXError</span>, <span Class="bold">printModeXError</span> and <span Class="bold">printOptsXError</span> resources. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">print-redir()</span> This action toggles the <span Class="bold">printerControlMode</span> between 0 and 2. The corresponding popup menu entry is useful for switching the printer off if you happen to change your mind after deciding to print random binary files on the terminal. 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">quit()</span> This action sends a SIGHUP to the subprogram and exits. It is also invoked by the <span Class="bold">quit</span> entry in <span Class="emphasis">mainMenu</span>.

<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">An adjustment can be specified for these values by appending a *(``+*('' or *(``-*('' sign followed by a number, e.g., <span Class="emphasis">page-2</span> to specify 2 lines less than a page. 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If the third parameter <span Class="emphasis">mouse</span> is given, the action is ignored when mouse reporting is enabled.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The default bindings in the Tektronix window are analogous but less extensive. These are for the <span Class="bold">tek4014</span> widget:

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the clipboard, and unshifted select/paste for the primary selection. In each case, a (different) cut buffer is also a target or source of the select/paste operation. It is important to remember however, that cut buffers store data in ISO-8859-1 encoding, while selections can store data in a variety of formats and encodings. While <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> owns the selection, it highlights it. When it loses the selection, it removes the corresponding highlight. But you can still paste from the corresponding cut buffer. 
<p class="level0">*VT100*translations:    &#35;override \n\ &nbsp;   ~Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\ &nbsp;   Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;:  insert-selection(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1) \n\ &nbsp;   ~Shift&lt;BtnUp&gt;:       select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\ &nbsp;   Shift&lt;BtnUp&gt;:        select-end(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">In the example, the class name <a class="bold" href="#VT100">VT100</a> is used rather than the widget name. These are different; the class name provides a more-specific match than the widget name. A leading *(``**('' is used because the widget hierarchy above the <span Class="bold">vt100</span> widget depends on whether the toolbar support is compiled into <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>. 
<p class="level0">Below is shown a sample of how the <span Class="bold">keymap()</span> action may be used to add special keys for entering commonly-typed works: 
<p class="level0">*VT100.Translations: &#35;override &lt;Key&gt;F13: keymap(dbx) *VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \ &nbsp;       &lt;Key&gt;F14:       keymap(None) \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;Key&gt;F17:       string("next") string(0x0d) \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;Key&gt;F18:       string("step") string(0x0d) \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;Key&gt;F19:       string("continue") string(0x0d) \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;Key&gt;F20:       string("print ") insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) 
<p class="level0"><a name="DEFAULT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DEFAULT SCROLLBAR BINDINGS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Key bindings are normally associated with the <span Class="bold">vt100</span> or <span Class="bold">tek4014</span> widgets which act as terminal emulators. <span Class="emphasis">*N</span>'s scrollbar (and toolbar if it is configured) are separate widgets. Because all of these use the X Toolkit, they have corresponding <span Class="bold">translations</span> resources. Those resources are distinct, and match different patterns, e.g., the differences in widget-name and number of levels of widgets which they may contain. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> widget is a child of the <span Class="bold">vt100</span> widget. It is positioned on top of the <span Class="bold">vt100</span> widget. Toggling the scrollbar on and off causes the <span Class="bold">vt100</span> widget to resize. 
<p class="level0">The default bindings for the scrollbar widget use only mouse-button events: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;                     &lt;Btn5Down&gt;: StartScroll(Forward) \n\ &nbsp;                     &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: StartScroll(Forward) \n\ &nbsp;                     &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\ &nbsp;                     &lt;Btn3Down&gt;: StartScroll(Backward) \n\ &nbsp;                     &lt;Btn4Down&gt;: StartScroll(Backward) \n\ &nbsp;                     &lt;Btn2Motion&gt;: MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\ &nbsp;                     &lt;BtnUp&gt;:    NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll() 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Events which the <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> widget does not recognize at all are lost. 
<p class="level0">However, at startup, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> augments these translations with the default translations used for the <span Class="bold">vt100</span> widget, together with the resource *(``actions*('' which those translations use. Because the <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> (or <span Class="bold">menubar</span>) widgets do not recognize these actions (but because it has a corresponding <span Class="bold">translation</span>), they are passed on to the <span Class="bold">vt100</span> widget. 
<p class="level0">This augmenting of the scrollbar's translations has a few limitations: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">*N</span> knows what the default translations are, but there is no suitable library interface for determining what customizations a user may have added to the <span Class="bold">vt100</span> widget. All that <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> can do is augment the <span Class="bold">scrollbar</span> widget to give it the same starting point for further customization by the user. 
<p class="level0">Events in the gap between the widgets may be lost. 
<p class="level0">Compose sequences begun in one widget cannot be completed in the other, because the input methods for each widget do not share context information. 
<p class="level0">Most customizations of the scrollbar translations do not concern key bindings. Rather, users are generally more interested in changing the bindings of the mouse buttons. For example, some people prefer using the left pointer button for dragging the scrollbar thumb. That can be set up by altering the translations resource, e.g., 
<p class="level0">*VT100.scrollbar.translations:  &#35;override \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;Btn5Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Forward) \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;Btn4Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Backward) \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;Btn1Motion&gt;:   MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\ &nbsp;       &lt;BtnUp&gt;:        NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll() 
<p class="level0"><a name="CONTROL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">CONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">Xterm Control Sequences</span> document lists the control sequences which an application can send <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> to make it perform various operations.

<p class="level1">XTERM_SHELL is set to the pathname of the program which is invoked. Usually that is a shell program, e.g., <span Class="emphasis">/bin/sh</span>. Since it is not necessarily a shell program however, it is distinct from *(``SHELL*(''. 
<p class="level1">XTERM_VERSION is set to the string displayed by the <span Class="bold">-version</span> option. That is normally an identifier for the X Window libraries used to build <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>, followed by <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>'s patch number in parenthesis. The patch number is also part of the response to a Secondary Device Attributes (DA) control sequence (see <span Class="emphasis">Xterm Control Sequences</span>). 
<p class="level1">

<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">If you have set this to an pathname which does not correspond to a valid shell, <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> may unset it, to avoid confusion. 
<p class="level1">TERMCAP the contents of the termcap entry corresponding to $TERM, with lines and columns values substituted for the actual size window you have created.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Large pastes do not work on some systems. This is not a bug in <span Class="emphasis">*n</span>; it is a bug in the pseudo terminal driver of those systems. <span Class="emphasis">*n</span> feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty will accept data, but some pty drivers do not return enough information to know if the write has succeeded. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">When connected to an input method, it is possible for *n to hang if the XIM server is suspended or killed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Many of the options are not resettable after <span Class="emphasis">\*n</span> starts. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">This program still needs to be rewritten. It should be split into very modular sections, with the various emulators being completely separate widgets that do not know about each other. Ideally, you'd like to be able to pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single control widget. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek COPY file name.
