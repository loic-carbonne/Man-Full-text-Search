<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">devnag</span> is a preprocessor that reads transliterated Devanagari input delimited by dn and converts it into a form with which TeX is familiar. 
<p class="level0">The preprocessor handles the details of character placement such as the alignment of vowel diacritics and consonant ligatures. The rest of the layout, however, must be managed by the user.  
<p class="level0">For specification of the format please see the documentation accompanying the package. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">in[.dn] out[.tex] The default file extension for an input file is .dn and for an output file .tex. The output filename is optional. If an output filename is not specified, the preprocessor will name it after the input file.
