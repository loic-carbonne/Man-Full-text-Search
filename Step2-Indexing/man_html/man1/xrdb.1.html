<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">xrdb</span> [-option ...] [<span Class="emphasis">filename</span>] <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Xrdb</span> is used to get or set the contents of the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of screen 0, or the SCREEN_RESOURCES property on the root window of any or all screens, or everything combined. You would normally run this program from your X startup file. 
<p class="level0">Most X clients use the RESOURCE_MANAGER and SCREEN_RESOURCES properties to get user preferences about color, fonts, and so on for applications.  Having this information in the server (where it is available to all clients) instead of on disk, solves the problem in previous versions of X that required you to maintain <span Class="emphasis">defaults</span> files on every machine that you might use. It also allows for dynamic changing of defaults without editing files. 
<p class="level0">The RESOURCE_MANAGER property is used for resources that apply to all screens of the display.  The SCREEN_RESOURCES property on each screen specifies additional (or overriding) resources to be used for that screen. (When there is only one screen, SCREEN_RESOURCES is normally not used, all resources are just placed in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.) 
<p class="level0">The file specified by <span Class="emphasis">filename</span> (or the contents from standard input if - or no filename is given) is optionally passed through the C preprocessor with the following symbols defined, based on the capabilities of the server being used: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SERVERHOST=hostname</span> the hostname portion of the display to which you are connected. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SRVR_name\fB</span> the SERVERHOST hostname string turned into a legal identifier. For example, "my-dpy.lcs.mit.edu" becomes SRVR_my_dpy_lcs_mit_edu. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HOST=hostname</span> the same as <span Class="manpage">SERVERHOST .</span>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">DISPLAY_NUM=num</span> the number of the display on the server host. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CLIENTHOST=hostname</span> the name of the host on which <span Class="emphasis">xrdb</span> is running. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CLNT_name\fB</span> the CLIENTHOST hostname string turned into a legal identifier. For example, "expo.lcs.mit.edu" becomes CLNT_expo_lcs_mit_edu. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">RELEASE=num</span> the vendor release number for the server.  The interpretation of this number will vary depending on VENDOR. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">REVISION=num</span> the X protocol minor version supported by this server (currently 0). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">VERSION=num</span> the X protocol major version supported by this server (should always be 11). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">VENDOR=vendor</span> a string literal specifying the vendor of the server. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">VNDR_name</span> the VENDOR name string turned into a legal identifier. For example, "MIT X Consortium" becomes VNDR_MIT_X_Consortium. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">EXT_name</span> A symbol is defined for each protocol extension supported by the server. Each extension string name is turned into a legal identifier. For example, "X3D-PEX" becomes EXT_X3D_PEX. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">NUM_SCREENS=num</span> the total number of screens. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">SCREEN_NUM=num</span> the number of the current screen (from zero). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">BITS_PER_RGB=num</span> the number of significant bits in an RGB color specification.  This is the log base 2 of the number of distinct shades of each primary that the hardware can generate.  Note that it usually is not related to PLANES. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CLASS=visualclass</span> one of StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor, DirectColor.  This is the visual class of the root window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CLASS_visualclass=visualid</span> the visual class of the root window in a form you can <span Class="emphasis">&#35;ifdef</span> on. The value is the numeric id of the visual. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">COLOR</span> defined only if CLASS is one of StaticColor, PseudoColor, TrueColor, or DirectColor. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">CLASS_visualclass_depth=num</span> A symbol is defined for each visual supported for the screen. The symbol includes the class of the visual and its depth; the value is the numeric id of the visual. (If more than one visual has the same class and depth, the numeric id of the first one reported by the server is used.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">HEIGHT=num</span> the height of the root window in pixels. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">WIDTH=num</span> the width of the root window in pixels. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PLANES=num</span> the number of bit planes (the depth) of the root window. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">X_RESOLUTION=num</span> the x resolution of the screen in pixels per meter. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Y_RESOLUTION=num</span> the y resolution of the screen in pixels per meter. 
<p class="level0">SRVR_<span Class="emphasis">name</span>, CLNT_<span Class="emphasis">name</span>, VNDR_<span Class="emphasis">name</span>, and EXT_<span Class="emphasis">name</span> identifiers are formed by changing all characters other than letters and digits into underscores (_). 
<p class="level0">Lines that begin with an exclamation mark (!) are ignored and may be used as comments. 
<p class="level0">Note that since <span Class="emphasis">xrdb</span> can read from standard input, it can be used to the change the contents of properties directly from a terminal or from a shell script. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">xrdb</span> program accepts the following options: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-help</span> This option (or any unsupported option) will cause a brief description of the allowable options and parameters to be printed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-version</span> This option will cause the xrdb version to be printed and the program to exit without performing any other operations. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-display display</span> This option specifies the X server to be used; see <span Class="emphasis">X(7)</span>. It also specifies the screen to use for the <span Class="emphasis">-screen</span> option, and it specifies the screen from which preprocessor symbols are derived for the <span Class="emphasis">-global</span> option. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-all</span> This option indicates that operation should be performed on the screen-independent resource property (RESOURCE_MANAGER), as well as the screen-specific property (SCREEN_RESOURCES) on every screen of the display.  For example, when used in conjunction with <span Class="emphasis">-query</span>, the contents of all properties are output.  For <span Class="emphasis">-load</span>, <span Class="emphasis">-override</span> and <span Class="emphasis">-merge</span>, the input file is processed once for each screen.  The resources which occur in common in the output for every screen are collected, and these are applied as the screen-independent resources.  The remaining resources are applied for each individual per-screen property.  This the default mode of operation. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-global</span> This option indicates that the operation should only be performed on the screen-independent RESOURCE_MANAGER property. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-screen</span> This option indicates that the operation should only be performed on the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of the default screen of the display. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-screens</span> This option indicates that the operation should be performed on the SCREEN_RESOURCES property of each screen of the display. For <span Class="emphasis">-load</span>, <span Class="emphasis">-override</span> and <span Class="emphasis">-merge</span>, the input file is processed for each screen. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-n</span> This option indicates that changes to the specified properties (when used with <span Class="emphasis">-load</span>, <span Class="emphasis">-override</span> or <span Class="emphasis">-merge</span>) or to the resource file (when used with <span Class="emphasis">-edit</span>) should be shown on the standard output, but should not be performed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-quiet</span> This option indicates that warning about duplicate entries should not be displayed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-cpp filename</span> This option specifies the pathname of the C preprocessor program to be used. Although <span Class="emphasis">xrdb</span> was designed to use CPP, any program that acts as a filter and accepts the -D, -I, and -U options may be used. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-nocpp</span> This option indicates that <span Class="emphasis">xrdb</span> should not run the input file through a preprocessor before loading it into properties. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-undef</span> This option is passed to the C preprocessor if used. It prevents it from predefining any system specific macros. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-symbols</span> This option indicates that the symbols that are defined for the preprocessor should be printed onto the standard output. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-query</span> This option indicates that the current contents of the specified properties should be printed onto the standard output.  Note that since preprocessor commands in the input resource file are part of the input file, not part of the property, they won't appear in the output from this option.  The <span Class="bold">-edit</span> option can be used to merge the contents of properties back into the input resource file without damaging preprocessor commands. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-load</span> This option indicates that the input should be loaded as the new value of the specified properties, replacing whatever was there (i.e. the old contents are removed).  This is the default action. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-override</span> This option indicates that the input should be added to, instead of replacing, the current contents of the specified properties. New entries override previous entries. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-merge</span> This option indicates that the input should be merged and lexicographically sorted with, instead of replacing, the current contents of the specified properties. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-remove</span> This option indicates that the specified properties should be removed from the server. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-retain</span> This option indicates that the server should be instructed not to reset if <span Class="emphasis">xrdb</span> is the first client.  This should never be necessary under normal conditions, since <span Class="emphasis">xdm</span> and <span Class="emphasis">xinit</span> always act as the first client. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-edit filename</span> This option indicates that the contents of the specified properties should be edited into the given file, replacing any values already listed there.  This allows you to put changes that you have made to your defaults back into your resource file, preserving any comments or preprocessor lines. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-backup string</span> This option specifies a suffix to be appended to the filename used with <span Class="bold">-edit</span> to generate a backup file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Dname[=value]</span> This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to define symbols for use with conditionals such as <span Class="emphasis">#ifdef.</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Uname</span> This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to remove any definitions of this symbol. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Idirectory</span> This option is passed through to the preprocessor and is used to specify a directory to search for files that are referenced with <span Class="emphasis">#include.</span> <a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Xrdb</span> does not load any files on its own, but many desktop environments use xrdb to load <span Class="emphasis">~/.Xresources</span> files on session startup to initialize the resource database, as a generalized replacement for <span Class="emphasis">~/.Xdefaults</span> files. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
