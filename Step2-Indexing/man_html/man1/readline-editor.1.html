<p class="level0">ledit - line editor, version 2.03 
<p class="level0"><a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ledit</span> [-h <span Class="emphasis">file</span>] [-x] [-t] [-l <span Class="emphasis">length</span>] [-a | -u] [<span Class="emphasis">command options</span>] 
<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">The command <span Class="emphasis">ledit</span> allows to edit lines one by one when running an interactive command. When typing a line, some keys with control or meta are interpreted: it is possible to insert characters in the middle of the line, go to the beginning or the end of the line, get a previous line, search for a line with a pattern, etc. 
<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">The options are: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-h file</span> Save the lines typed (history) in <span Class="emphasis">file</span>. The default is to have them only in memory (so, they are lost at the end of the program). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-x</span> Extend the history file (given in option "-h") if it already exists. The default is to truncate the history file. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t</span> Display the sequences generated by the keys (for debugging). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v</span> Print ledit version and exit. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-l length</span> Tells that <span Class="emphasis">length</span> is the maximum line length displayed. If the line edited is longer than this length, the line scrolls horizontally, while editing. The default value is 70. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-a</span> Ascii encoding: characters whose code is greater than 128 are displayed with a backslash followed by their code. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-u</span> Unicode encoding: the terminal must have been set in unicode mode. See commands <span Class="bold">unicode_start</span> and <span Class="bold">unicode_stop</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">command options</span> Runs the command <span Class="emphasis">command</span> and its possible options. This must be the last option of ledit. The default value is "cat". 
<p class="level0"><a name="KEYS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">KEYS BINDINGS</h2>
<p class="level0">When ledit starts, some default key bindings are defined. The can be completed with a "leditrc" file. See the section <a class="bold" href="#LEDITRC">LEDITRC</a>. 
<p class="level0">In the following lines, the caret sign "^" means "control" and the sequence "M-" means "meta" (either with the "meta" prefix, or by pressing the "escape" key before). Examples: 
<p class="level0">^a press the "control" key, then press "a", then release "a", then release "control". 
<p class="level0">M-a press the "meta" key, then press "a", then release "a", then release "meta", or: press and release the "escape" key, then press and release "a" (the manipulation with "meta" may not work in some systems: in this case, use the manipulation with "escape"). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The default editing commands are: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;     ^a   : beginning of line
&nbsp;     ^e   : end of line
&nbsp;     ^f   : forward char
&nbsp;     ^b   : backward char
&nbsp;     M-f  : forward word
&nbsp;     M-b  : backward word
&nbsp;     TAB  : complete file name
&nbsp;     ^p   : previous line in history
&nbsp;     ^n   : next line in history
&nbsp;     M-&lt;  : first line in history
&nbsp;     M-&gt;  : last line in history
&nbsp;     ^r   : reverse search in history (see below)
&nbsp;     ^d   : delete char (or EOF if the line is empty)
&nbsp;     ^h   : (or backspace) backward delete char
&nbsp;     ^t   : transpose chars
&nbsp;     M-c  : capitalize word
&nbsp;     M-u  : upcase word
&nbsp;     M-l  : downcase word
&nbsp;     M-d  : kill word
&nbsp;     M-^h : (or M-del or M-backspace) backward kill word
&nbsp;     ^q   : insert next char
&nbsp;     M-/  : expand abbreviation
&nbsp;     ^k   : cut until end of line
&nbsp;     ^y   : paste
&nbsp;     ^u   : line discard
&nbsp;     ^l   : redraw current line
&nbsp;     ^g   : abort prefix
&nbsp;     ^c   : interrupt
&nbsp;     ^z   : suspend
&nbsp;     ^&nbsp;  : quit
&nbsp;     return : send line
&nbsp;     ^x     : send line and show next history line
&nbsp;     other  : insert char
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The arrow keys can be used, providing your keyword returns standard key sequences: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;     up arrow    : previous line in history
&nbsp;     down arrow  : next line in history
&nbsp;     right arrow : forward char
&nbsp;     left arrow  : backward char
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Other keys: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;     home        : beginning of line
&nbsp;     end         : end of line
&nbsp;     delete      : delete char
&nbsp;     page up     : previous line in history
&nbsp;     page down   : next line in history
&nbsp;     shift home  : beginning of history
&nbsp;     shift end   : end of history
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="REVERSE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">REVERSE SEARCH</h2>
<p class="level0">The reverse search in incremental, i.e. <span Class="emphasis">ledit</span> backward searches in the history a line holding the characters typed. If you type "a", its search the first line before the current line holding an "a" and displays it. If you then type a "b", its search a line holding "ab", and so on. If you type ^h (or backspace), it returns to the previous line found. To cancel the search, type ^g. To find another line before holding the same string, type ^r. To stop the editing and display the current line found, type "escape" (other commands of the normal editing, different from ^h, ^g, and ^r stop the editing too). 
<p class="level0">Summary of reverse search commands: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;     ^g  : abort search
&nbsp;     ^r  : search previous same pattern
&nbsp;     ^h  : (or backspace) search without the last char
&nbsp;     del : search without the last char
&nbsp;     any other command : stop search and show the line found
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="LEDITRC"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">LEDITRC</h2>
<p class="level0">If the environment variable LEDITRC is set, it contains the name of the leditrc file. Otherwise it is the file named ".leditrc" in user's home directory. When starting, ledit reads this file, if it exists, to modify or complete the default bindings. If this file is changed while reading lines, it is read again to take the new file into account. 
<p class="level0">Bindings lines are the ones which start with a string defining the key sequence and follow with a colon and a binding. A binding is either a string or a command. The other lines are ignored For example,the line: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;   "\C-a": beginning-of-line
</pre>

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">binds the sequence "control-a" to the command "beginning-of-line". 
<p class="level0">The key sequence may contain the specific meta-sequences: 
<p class="level0"><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;   \C-   followed by a key: "control" of this key
&nbsp;   \M-   followed by a key: "meta" of this key
&nbsp;   \e    the "escape" key
&nbsp;   \nnn  where nnn is one, two, or three octal digits, or:
&nbsp;   \xnn  where nn is one or two hexadecimal digits:
&nbsp;           the binary representation of a byte
&nbsp;   \a    bell = \C-g
&nbsp;   \b    backspace = \C-h
&nbsp;   \d    delete = \277
&nbsp;   \f    form feed = \C-l
&nbsp;   \n    newline = \C-j
&nbsp;   \r    carriage return = \C-m
&nbsp;   \t    tabulation = \C-i
&nbsp;   \v    vertical tabulation = \C-k
</pre>

<p class="level0"><a name="KNOWN"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">KNOWN BUGS</h2>
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">ledit</span> has been launched in a shell script, the suspend command kills it and its command... Use "exec ledit comm" instead of "ledit comm". <br>The suspend command stops <span Class="emphasis">ledit</span> but not the called program. Do not do this if the called program is not waiting on standard input. <br>In some systems (e.g. alpha), pasting two many characters works bad and may block the terminal. Probably a kernel problem. No solution.
