<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">eVim</span> starts <span Class="bold">Vim</span> and sets options to make it behave like a modeless editor. This is still Vim but used as a point-and-click editor. This feels a lot like using Notepad on MS-Windows. <span Class="bold">eVim</span> will always run in the GUI, to enable the use of menus and toolbar. 
<p class="level0">Only to be used for people who really can't work with Vim in the normal way. Editing will be much less efficient. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">eview</span> is the same, but starts in read-only mode.  It works just like evim -R. 
<p class="level0">See vim(1) for details about Vim, options, etc. 
<p class="level0">The 'insertmode' option is set to be able to type text directly. <br>Mappings are setup to make Copy and Paste work with the MS-Windows keys. CTRL-X cuts text, CTRL-C copies text and CTRL-V pastes text. Use CTRL-Q to obtain the original meaning of CTRL-V. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
