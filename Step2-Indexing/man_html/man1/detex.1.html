<p class="level0">detex - a filter to strip <span Class="emphasis">TeX</span> commands from a .tex file. <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">detex</span> [ <span Class="bold">-clnstw</span> ] [ <span class="bold">-e<span Class="emphasis"> environment-list</span> ] [ <span Class="emphasis">filename</span>[.tex] ... ] <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Detex</span> (Version 2.6) reads each file in sequence, removes all comments and <span Class="emphasis">TeX</span> control sequences and writes the remainder on the standard output. All text in math mode and display mode is removed. By default, <span Class="emphasis">detex</span> follows \input commands. If a file cannot be opened, a warning message is printed and the command is ignored. If the <span Class="bold">-n</span> option is used, no \input or \include commands will be processed. This allows single file processing. If no input file is given on the command line, <span Class="emphasis">detex</span> reads from standard input. 
<p class="level0">If the magic sequence ``\begin{document}'' appears in the text, <span Class="emphasis">detex</span> assumes it is dealing with <span Class="emphasis">LaTeX</span> source and <span Class="emphasis">detex</span> recognizes additional constructs used in <span Class="emphasis">LaTeX .</span> These include the \include and \includeonly commands. The <span Class="bold">-l</span> option can be used to force <span Class="emphasis">LaTeX</span> mode and the <span Class="bold">-t</span> option can be used to force <span Class="emphasis">TeX</span> mode regardless of input content. 
<p class="level0">Text in various environment modes of <span Class="emphasis">LaTeX</span> is ignored.  The default modes are array, eqnarray, equation, figure, mathmatica, picture, table and verbatim.  The <span Class="bold">-e</span> option can be used to specify a comma separated <span Class="emphasis">environment-list</span> of environments to ignore.  The list replaces the defaults so specifying an empty list effectively causes no environments to be ignored. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-c</span> option can be used in <span Class="emphasis">LaTeX</span> mode to have detex echo the arguments to \cite, \ref, and \pageref macros.  This can be useful when sending the output to a style checker. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Detex</span> assumes the standard character classes are being used for <span Class="emphasis">TeX .</span> <span Class="emphasis">Detex</span> allows white space between control sequences and magic characters like `{' when recognizing things like <span Class="emphasis">LaTeX</span> environments. 
<p class="level0">If the <span Class="bold">-w</span> flag is given, the output is a word list, one `word' (string of two or more letters and apostrophes beginning with a letter) per line, and all other characters ignored. Without <span Class="bold">-w</span> the output follows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.  Newline characters are preserved where possible so that the lines of output match the input as closely as possible. 
<p class="level0">The TEXINPUTS environment variable is used to find \input and \include files.  Like <span Class="emphasis">TeX</span>, it interprets a leading or trailing `:' as the default TEXINPUTS.  It does <span Class="emphasis">not</span> support the `//' directory expansion magic sequence. 
<p class="level0">Detex now handles the basic <span Class="emphasis">TeX</span> ligatures as a special case, replacing the ligatures with acceptable charater substitutes.  This eliminates spelling errors introduced by merely removing them.  The ligatures are \aa, \ae, \oe, \ss, \o, \l (and their upper-case equivalents).  The special "dotless" characters \i and \j are also replaced with i and j respectively. 
<p class="level0">Note that previous versions of <span Class="emphasis">detex</span> would replace control sequences with a space character to prevent words from running together. However, this caused accents in the middle of words to break words, generating "spelling errors" that were not desirable. Therefore, the new version merely removes these accents. The old functionality can be essentially duplicated by using the <span Class="bold">-s</span> option. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>

<p class="level0">Nesting of \input is allowed but the number of opened files must not exceed the system's limit on the number of simultaneously opened files. <span Class="emphasis">Detex</span> ignores unrecognized option characters after printing a warning message. <a name="AUTHOR"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Detex</span> is not a complete <span Class="emphasis">TeX</span> interpreter, so it can be confused by some constructs. Most errors result in too much rather than too little output. 
<p class="level0">Running <span Class="emphasis">LaTeX</span> source without a ``\begin{document}'' through <span Class="emphasis">detex</span> may produce errors. 
<p class="level0">Suggestions for improvements are (mildly) encouraged.
