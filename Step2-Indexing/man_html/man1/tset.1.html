<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Tset</span> initializes terminals. <span Class="bold">Tset</span> first determines the type of terminal that you are using. This determination is done as follows, using the first terminal type found. 
<p class="level0">1. The <span Class="bold">terminal</span> argument specified on the command line. 
<p class="level0">2. The value of the <span Class="bold">TERM</span> environmental variable. 
<p class="level0">3. (BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with the standard error output device in the <span Class="emphasis">/etc/ttys</span> file. (On System-V-like UNIXes and systems using that convention, <span Class="emphasis">getty</span> does this job by setting <span Class="bold">TERM</span> according to the type passed to it by <span Class="emphasis">/etc/inittab</span>.) 
<p class="level0">4. The default terminal type, *(``unknown*(''. 
<p class="level0">If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the <span Class="bold">-m</span> option mappings are then applied (see the section <a class="bold" href="#TERMINAL">TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING</a> for more information). Then, if the terminal type begins with a question mark (*(``?*(''), the user is prompted for confirmation of the terminal type.  An empty response confirms the type, or, another type can be entered to specify a new type.  Once the terminal type has been determined, the terminfo entry for the terminal is retrieved.  If no terminfo entry is found for the type, the user is prompted for another terminal type. 
<p class="level0">Once the terminfo entry is retrieved, the window size, backspace, interrupt and line kill characters (among many other things) are set and the terminal and tab initialization strings are sent to the standard error output. Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill characters have changed, or are not set to their default values, their values are displayed to the standard error output. Use the <span Class="bold">-c</span> or <span Class="bold">-w</span> option to select only the window sizing versus the other initialization. If neither option is given, both are assumed. 
<p class="level0">When invoked as <span Class="bold">reset</span>, <span Class="bold">tset</span> sets cooked and echo modes, turns off cbreak and raw modes, turns on newline translation and resets any unset special characters to their default values before doing the terminal initialization described above.  This is useful after a program dies leaving a terminal in an abnormal state.  Note, you may have to type 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;   <span Class="bold">&lt;LF&gt;reset&lt;LF&gt;</span> 
<p class="level0">(the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the terminal to work, as carriage-return may no longer work in the abnormal state. Also, the terminal will often not echo the command. 
<p class="level0">The options are as follows: 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-c</span> Set control characters and modes. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-e</span> Set the erase character to <span Class="emphasis">ch</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-I</span> Do not send the terminal or tab initialization strings to the terminal. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-i</span> Set the interrupt character to <span Class="emphasis">ch</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-k</span> Set the line kill character to <span Class="emphasis">ch</span>. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-m</span> Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal. See the section <a class="bold" href="#TERMINAL">TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING</a> for more information. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-Q</span> Do not display any values for the erase, interrupt and line kill characters. Normally <span Class="bold">tset</span> displays the values for control characters which differ from the system's default values. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-q</span> The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and the terminal is not initialized in any way.  The option `-' by itself is equivalent but archaic. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-r</span> Print the terminal type to the standard error output. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s</span> Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize the environment variable <span Class="bold">TERM</span> to the standard output. See the section <a class="bold" href="#SETTING">SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT</a> for details. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-V</span> reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-w</span> Resize the window to match the size deduced via <span Class="bold">setupterm</span>. Normally this has no effect, unless <span Class="bold">setupterm</span> is not able to detect the window size. 
<p class="level0">The arguments for the <span Class="bold">-e</span>, <span Class="bold">-i</span>, and <span Class="bold">-k</span> options may either be entered as actual characters or by using the `hat' notation, i.e., control-h may be specified as *(``^H*('' or *(``^h*(''. 
<p class="level0"><a name="SETTING"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information about the terminal's capabilities into the shell's environment. This is done using the <span Class="bold">-s</span> option. 
<p class="level0">When the <span Class="bold">-s</span> option is specified, the commands to enter the information into the shell's environment are written to the standard output.  If the <span Class="bold">SHELL</span> environmental variable ends in *(``csh*('', the commands are for <span Class="bold">csh</span>, otherwise, they are for <span Class="bold">sh</span>. Note, the <span Class="bold">csh</span> commands set and unset the shell variable <span Class="bold">noglob</span>, leaving it unset.  The following line in the <span Class="bold">.login</span> or <span Class="bold">.profile</span> files will initialize the environment correctly: 
<p class="level0">&nbsp;   eval `tset -s options ... ` 
<p class="level0"><a name="TERMINAL"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING</h2>
<p class="level0">When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the current system information is incorrect) the terminal type derived from the <span Class="emphasis">/etc/ttys</span> file or the <span Class="bold">TERM</span> environmental variable is often something generic like <span Class="bold">network</span>, <span Class="bold">dialup</span>, or <span Class="bold">unknown</span>. When <span Class="bold">tset</span> is used in a startup script it is often desirable to provide information about the type of terminal used on such ports. 
<p class="level0">The purpose of the <span Class="bold">-m</span> option is to map from some set of conditions to a terminal type, that is, to tell <span Class="bold">tset</span> *(``If I'm on this port at a particular speed, guess that I'm on that kind of terminal*(''. 
<p class="level0">The argument to the <span Class="bold">-m</span> option consists of an optional port type, an optional operator, an optional baud rate specification, an optional colon (*(``:*('') character and a terminal type.  The port type is a string (delimited by either the operator or the colon character). The operator may be any combination of *(``&gt;*('', *(``&lt;*('', *(``@*('', and *(``!*(''; *(``&gt;*('' means greater than, *(``&lt;*('' means less than, *(``@*('' means equal to and *(``!*('' inverts the sense of the test. The baud rate is specified as a number and is compared with the speed of the standard error output (which should be the control terminal). The terminal type is a string. 
<p class="level0">If the terminal type is not specified on the command line, the <span Class="bold">-m</span> mappings are applied to the terminal type.  If the port type and baud rate match the mapping, the terminal type specified in the mapping replaces the current type.  If more than one mapping is specified, the first applicable mapping is used. 
<p class="level0">For example, consider the following mapping: <span Class="bold">dialup&gt;9600:vt100</span>. The port type is dialup , the operator is &gt;, the baud rate specification is 9600, and the terminal type is vt100.  The result of this mapping is to specify that if the terminal type is <span Class="bold">dialup</span>, and the baud rate is greater than 9600 baud, a terminal type of <span Class="bold">vt100</span> will be used. 
<p class="level0">If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type will match any baud rate. If no port type is specified, the terminal type will match any port type. For example, <span Class="bold">-m dialup:vt100 -m :?xterm</span> will cause any dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type vt100, and any non-dialup port type to match the terminal type ?xterm. Note, because of the leading question mark, the user will be queried on a default port as to whether they are actually using an xterm terminal. 
<p class="level0">No whitespace characters are permitted in the <span Class="bold">-m</span> option argument. Also, to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested that the entire <span Class="bold">-m</span> option argument be placed within single quote characters, and that <span Class="bold">csh</span> users insert a backslash character (*(``e*('') before any exclamation marks (*(``!*(''). <a name="HISTORY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">HISTORY</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">tset</span> command appeared in BSD 3.0.  The <span Class="bold">ncurses</span> implementation was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD sources for a terminfo environment by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;. <a name="COMPATIBILITY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMPATIBILITY</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">tset</span> utility has been provided for backward-compatibility with BSD environments (under most modern UNIXes, <span Class="bold">/etc/inittab</span> and <span Class="emphasis">getty</span>(1) can set <span Class="bold">TERM</span> appropriately for each dial-up line; this obviates what was <span Class="bold">tset</span>'s most important use).  This implementation behaves like 4.4BSD tset, with a few exceptions specified here. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-S</span> option of BSD tset no longer works; it prints an error message to stderr and dies. The <span Class="bold">-s</span> option only sets <span Class="bold">TERM</span>, not <span Class="bold">TERMCAP</span>. Both of these changes are because the <span Class="bold">TERMCAP</span> variable is no longer supported under terminfo-based <span Class="bold">ncurses</span>, which makes <span Class="bold">tset -S</span> useless (we made it die noisily rather than silently induce lossage). 
<p class="level0">There was an undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking tset via a link named `TSET` (or via any other name beginning with an upper-case letter) set the terminal to use upper-case only.  This feature has been omitted. 
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">-A</span>, <span Class="bold">-E</span>, <span Class="bold">-h</span>, <span Class="bold">-u</span> and <span Class="bold">-v</span> options were deleted from the <span Class="bold">tset</span> utility in 4.4BSD. None of them were documented in 4.3BSD and all are of limited utility at best. The <span Class="bold">-a</span>, <span Class="bold">-d</span>, and <span Class="bold">-p</span> options are similarly not documented or useful, but were retained as they appear to be in widespread use.  It is strongly recommended that any usage of these three options be changed to use the <span Class="bold">-m</span> option instead. The <span Class="bold">-n</span> option remains, but has no effect. The <span Class="bold">-adnp</span> options are therefore omitted from the usage summary above. 
<p class="level0">It is still permissible to specify the <span Class="bold">-e</span>, <span Class="bold">-i</span>, and <span Class="bold">-k</span> options without arguments, although it is strongly recommended that such usage be fixed to explicitly specify the character. 
<p class="level0">As of 4.4BSD, executing <span Class="bold">tset</span> as <span Class="bold">reset</span> no longer implies the <span Class="bold">-Q</span> option. Also, the interaction between the - option and the <span Class="emphasis">terminal</span> argument in some historic implementations of <span Class="bold">tset</span> has been removed. <a name="ENVIRONMENT"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="bold">tset</span> command uses these environment variables: 
<p class="level0">SHELL tells <span Class="bold">tset</span> whether to initialize <span Class="bold">TERM</span> using <span Class="bold">sh</span> or <span Class="bold">csh</span> syntax. 
<p class="level0">TERM Denotes your terminal type. Each terminal type is distinct, though many are similar. 
<p class="level0">TERMCAP may denote the location of a termcap database. If it is not an absolute pathname, e.g., begins with a `/', <span Class="bold">tset</span> removes the variable from the environment before looking for the terminal description. <a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILES</h2>
