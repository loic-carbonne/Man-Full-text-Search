<p class="level0">lessfile, lesspipe - "input preprocessor" for  less. <a name="SYNOPSIS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">lessfile, lesspipe</span> <a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0">This manual page documents briefly the <span Class="emphasis">lessfile ,</span> and <span Class="emphasis">lesspipe</span> commands. This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the input preprocessor scripts are provided by Debian GNU/Linux and are not part of the original program. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">lessfile</span> and <span Class="emphasis">lesspipe</span> are programs that can be used to modify the way the contents of a file are displayed in <span Class="emphasis">less.</span> What this means is that <span Class="emphasis">less</span> can automatically open up tar files, uncompress gzipped files, and even display something reasonable for graphics files. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">lesspipe</span> will toss the contents/info on STDOUT and <span Class="emphasis">less</span> will read them as they come across.  This means that you do not have to wait for the decoding to finish before less shows you the file.  This also means that you will get a 'byte N' instead of an N% as your file position.  You can seek to the end and back to get the N% but that means you have to wait for the pipe to finish. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">lessfile</span> will toss the contents/info on a file which <span Class="emphasis">less</span> will then read.  After you are done, <span Class="emphasis">lessfile</span> will then delete the file.  This means that the process has to finish before you see it, but you get nice percentages (N%) up front. 
<p class="level0"><a name="USAGE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USAGE</h2>
<p class="level0">Just put one of the following two commands in your login script (e.g. ~/.bash_profile): 
<p class="level0">&nbsp; eval "$(lessfile)" 
<p class="level0">or 
<p class="level0">&nbsp; eval "$(lesspipe)" <a name="FILE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">FILE TYPE RECOGNITION</h2>
<p class="level0">File types are recognized by their extensions. This is a list of currently supported extensions (grouped by the programs that handle them): 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">&nbsp; *.a &nbsp; *.arj &nbsp; *.tar.bz2 &nbsp; *.bz &nbsp; *.bz2 &nbsp; *.deb, *.udeb, *.ddeb &nbsp; *.doc &nbsp; *.gif, *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.pcd, *.png, *.tga, *.tiff, *.tif &nbsp; *.iso, *.raw, *.bin &nbsp; *.lha, *.lzh &nbsp; *.tar.lz, *.tlz &nbsp; *.lz &nbsp; *.7z &nbsp; *.pdf &nbsp; *.rar, *.r[0-9][0-9] &nbsp; *.rpm &nbsp; *.tar.gz, *.tgz, *.tar.z, *.tar.dz &nbsp; *.gz, *.z, *.dz &nbsp; *.tar &nbsp; *.tar.xz, *.xz &nbsp; *.jar, *.war, *.xpi, *.zip &nbsp; *.zoo <a name="USER"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">USER DEFINED FILTERS</h2>
<p class="level0">It is possible to extend and overwrite the default <span Class="emphasis">lesspipe</span> and <span Class="emphasis">lessfile</span> input processor if you have specialized requirements. Create an executable program with the name <span Class="emphasis">.lessfilter</span> and put it into your home directory. This can be a shell script or a binary program. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">It is important that this program returns the correct exit code: return 0 if your filter handles the input, return 1 if the standard <span Class="emphasis">lesspipe/lessfile</span> filter should handle the input. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Here is an example script: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">&nbsp; &#35;!/bin/sh 
<p class="level0">&nbsp; case "$1" in &nbsp;     *.extension) &nbsp;         extension-handler "$1" &nbsp;         ;; &nbsp;     *) &nbsp;         &#35; We don't handle this format. &nbsp;         exit 1 &nbsp; esac 
<p class="level0">&nbsp; &#35; No further processing by lesspipe necessary &nbsp; exit 0

<p class="level0">When trying to open compressed 0 byte files, <span Class="emphasis">less</span> displays the actual binary file contents. This is not a bug. <span Class="emphasis">less</span> is designed to do that (see manual page less(1), section INPUT PREPROCESSOR). This is the answer of Mark Nudelman &lt;markn@greenwoodsoftware.com&gt;: 
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> 
<p class="level1">"I recognized when I designed it that a lesspipe filter cannot output an empty file and have less display nothing in that case; it's a side effect of using the "no output" case to mean "the filter has nothing to do".  It could have been designed to have some other mechanism to indicate "nothing to do", but "no output" seemed the simplest and most intuitive for lesspipe writers." 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">Sometimes, less does not display the contents file you want to view but output that is produced by your login scripts (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile). This happens because less uses your current shell to run the lesspipe filter. Bash first looks for the variable $BASH_ENV in the environment expands its value and  uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute. If this file produces any output less will display this. A way to solve this problem is to put the following lines on the top of your login script that produces output: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">&nbsp; if [ -z "$PS1" ]; then &nbsp;     exit &nbsp; fi 
<p class="level1">This tests whether the prompt variable $PS1 is set and if it isn't (which is the case for non-interactive shells) it will exit the script. <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
