<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux. 
<p class="level0">It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, so you can see all the processes running on the system, along with their full command lines. 
<p class="level0">Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without entering their PIDs. <br><a name="COMMAND-LINE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d --delay=DELAY</span> Delay between updates, in tenths of seconds 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-C --no-color --no-colour</span> Start htop in monochrome mode 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-h --help Display a help message and exit 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-p --pid=PID,PID...</span> Show only the given PIDs 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s --sort-key COLUMN</span> Sort by this column (use --sort-key help for a column list) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-u --user=USERNAME</span> Show only the processes of a given user 
<p class="level0"><span class="bold">-v --version Output version information and exit 
<p class="level0"><br><a name="INTERACTIVE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">INTERACTIVE COMMANDS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The following commands are supported while in htop: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Arrows, PgUP, PgDn, Home, End</span> Scroll the process list. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Space</span> Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes, like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead of the currently highlighted one. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">U</span> Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">s</span> Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed, pressing this key will attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a live update of system calls issued by the process. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">l</span> Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing this key will display the list of file descriptors opened by the process. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">L</span> Trace process library calls: if ltrace(1) is installed, pressing this key will attach it to the currently selected process, presenting a live update of library calls issued by the process. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F1, h, ?</span> Go to the help screen 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F2, S</span> Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed at the top of the screen, set various display options, choose among color schemes, and select which columns are displayed, in which order. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F3, /</span> Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed processes. The currently selected (highlighted) command will update as you type. While in search mode, pressing F3 will cycle through matching occurrences. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F4, \\\\</span> Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line and only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering, enter the Filter option again and press Esc. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F5, t</span> Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between tree and your previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view will exit tree view. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F6</span> On sorted view, select a field for sorting, also accessible through &lt; and &gt;. The current sort field is indicated by a highlight in the header. On tree view, expand or collapse the current subtree. A "+" indicator in the tree node indicates that it is collapsed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F7, ]</span> Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice' value). This can only be done by the superuser. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F8, [</span> Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F9, k</span> "Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes. If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F10, q</span> Quit 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">I</span> Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing, and vice-versa. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">+, - </span> When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree is collapsed a "+" sign shows to the left of the process name. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">a (on multiprocessor machines)</span> Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">u</span> Show only processes owned by a specified user. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">M</span> Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">P</span> Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">T</span> Sort by time (top compatibility key). 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F</span> "Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on screen. When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">K</span> Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel to be displayed in the process list. (This is a toggle key.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">H</span> Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from userspace processes in the process list. (This is a toggle key.) 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Ctrl-L</span> Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Numbers</span> PID search: type in process ID and the selection highlight will be moved to it. 
<p class="level0">
