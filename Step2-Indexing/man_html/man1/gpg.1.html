<p class="level0"><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">gpg</span> is the OpenPGP only version of the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG). It is a tool to provide digital encryption and signing services using the OpenPGP standard. <span Class="bold">gpg</span> features complete key management and all bells and whistles you can expect from a decent OpenPGP implementation. 
<p class="level0">This is the standalone version of <span Class="bold">gpg</span>.  For desktop use you should consider using <span Class="bold">gpg2</span> from the GnuPG-2 package &nbsp;([On some platforms gpg2 is installed under the name <span Class="bold">gpg</span>]).

<p class="level0"><a name="RETURN"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">RETURN VALUE</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least a signature was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors. 
<p class="level0"><a name="WARNINGS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">WARNINGS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Use a *good* password for your user account and a *good* passphrase to protect your secret key. This passphrase is the weakest part of the whole system. Programs to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring are very easy to write and so you should protect your "~/.gnupg/" directory very well. 
<p class="level0">Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a network (telnet), it is *very* easy to spy out your passphrase! 
<p class="level0">If you are going to verify detached signatures, make sure that the program knows about it; either give both filenames on the command line or use (aq-(aq to specify STDIN. 
<p class="level0"><a name="INTEROPERABILITY"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">INTEROPERABILITY</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">GnuPG tries to be a very flexible implementation of the OpenPGP standard. In particular, GnuPG implements many of the optional parts of the standard, such as the SHA-512 hash, and the ZLIB and BZIP2 compression algorithms. It is important to be aware that not all OpenPGP programs implement these optional algorithms and that by forcing their use via the <span Class="bold">--cipher-algo</span>, <span Class="bold">--digest-algo</span>, <span Class="bold">--cert-digest-algo</span>, or <span Class="bold">--compress-algo</span> options in GnuPG, it is possible to create a perfectly valid OpenPGP message, but one that cannot be read by the intended recipient. 
<p class="level0">There are dozens of variations of OpenPGP programs available, and each supports a slightly different subset of these optional algorithms. For example, until recently, no (unhacked) version of PGP supported the BLOWFISH cipher algorithm. A message using BLOWFISH simply could not be read by a PGP user. By default, GnuPG uses the standard OpenPGP preferences system that will always do the right thing and create messages that are usable by all recipients, regardless of which OpenPGP program they use. Only override this safe default if you really know what you are doing. 
<p class="level0">If you absolutely must override the safe default, or if the preferences on a given key are invalid for some reason, you are far better off using the <span Class="bold">--pgp6</span>, <span Class="bold">--pgp7</span>, or <span Class="bold">--pgp8</span> options. These options are safe as they do not force any particular algorithms in violation of OpenPGP, but rather reduce the available algorithms to a "PGP-safe" list. 
<p class="level0"><a name="COMMANDS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">COMMANDS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that only one command is allowed. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">gpg</span> may be run with no commands, in which case it will perform a reasonable action depending on the type of file it is given as input (an encrypted message is decrypted, a signature is verified, a file containing keys is listed). 
<p class="level0">Please remember that option as well as command parsing stops as soon as a non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the special option <span Class="bold">--</span>.

<p class="level0">&nbsp; 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--sign</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-s</span> Make a signature. This command may be combined with <span Class="bold">--encrypt</span> (for a signed and encrypted message), <span Class="bold">--symmetric</span> (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), or <span Class="bold">--encrypt</span> and <span Class="bold">--symmetric</span> together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase).  The key to be used for signing is chosen by default or can be set with the <span Class="bold">--local-user</span> and <span Class="bold">--default-key</span> options. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--clearsign</span> Make a clear text signature.  The content in a clear text signature is readable without any special software. OpenPGP software is only needed to verify the signature.  Clear text signatures may modify end-of-line whitespace for platform independence and are not intended to be reversible.  The key to be used for signing is chosen by default or can be set with the <span Class="bold">--local-user</span> and <span Class="bold">--default-key</span> options. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--detach-sign</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-b</span> Make a detached signature. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--encrypt</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-e</span> Encrypt data. This option may be combined with <span Class="bold">--sign</span> (for a signed and encrypted message), <span Class="bold">--symmetric</span> (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or <span Class="bold">--sign</span> and <span Class="bold">--symmetric</span> together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--symmetric</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-c</span> Encrypt with a symmetric cipher using a passphrase. The default symmetric cipher used is CAST5, but may be chosen with the <span Class="bold">--cipher-algo</span> option. This option may be combined with <span Class="bold">--sign</span> (for a signed and symmetrically encrypted message), <span Class="bold">--encrypt</span> (for a message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase), or <span Class="bold">--sign</span> and <span Class="bold">--encrypt</span> together (for a signed message that may be decrypted via a secret key or a passphrase). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--store</span> Store only (make a simple <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1991.txt">RFC 1991</a> literal data packet). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--decrypt</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-d</span> Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file is specified) and write it to STDOUT (or the file specified with <span Class="bold">--output</span>). If the decrypted file is signed, the signature is also verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never writes to the filename which is included in the file and it rejects files which don't begin with an encrypted message. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--verify</span> Assume that the first argument is a signed file and verify it without generating any output.  With no arguments, the signature packet is read from STDIN.  If only a one argument is given, it is expected to be a complete signature. 
<p class="level0">With more than 1 argument, the first should be a detached signature and the remaining files ake up the the signed data. To read the signed data from STDIN, use (aq-(aq as the second filename.  For security reasons a detached signature cannot read the signed material from STDIN without denoting it in the above way. 
<p class="level0">Note: If the option <span Class="bold">--batch</span> is not used, <span Class="bold">gpg</span> may assume that a single argument is a file with a detached signature and it will try to find a matching data file by stripping certain suffixes.  Using this historical feature to verify a detached signature is strongly discouraged; always specify the data file too. 
<p class="level0">Note: When verifying a cleartext signature, <span Class="bold">gpg</span> verifies only what makes up the cleartext signed data and not any extra data outside of the cleartext signature or header lines following directly the dash marker line.  The option <span Class="bold">--output</span> may be used to write out the actual signed data; but there are other pitfalls with this format as well.  It is suggested to avoid cleartext signatures in favor of detached signatures. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--multifile</span> This modifies certain other commands to accept multiple files for processing on the command line or read from STDIN with each filename on a separate line. This allows for many files to be processed at once. <span Class="bold">--multifile</span> may currently be used along with <span Class="bold">--verify</span>, <span Class="bold">--encrypt</span>, and <span Class="bold">--decrypt</span>. Note that <span Class="bold">--multifile --verify</span> may not be used with detached signatures. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--verify-files</span> Identical to <span Class="bold">--multifile --verify</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--encrypt-files</span> Identical to <span Class="bold">--multifile --encrypt</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--decrypt-files</span> Identical to <span Class="bold">--multifile --decrypt</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--list-keys</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-k</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--list-public-keys</span> List all keys from the public keyrings, or just the keys given on the command line. 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-k</span> is slightly different from <span Class="bold">--list-keys</span> in that it allows only for one argument and takes the second argument as the keyring to search.  This is for command line compatibility with PGP 2 and has been removed in <span Class="bold">gpg2</span>. 
<p class="level0">Avoid using the output of this command in scripts or other programs as it is likely to change as GnuPG changes. See <span Class="bold">--with-colons</span> for a machine-parseable key listing command that is appropriate for use in scripts and other programs. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--list-secret-keys</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-K</span> List all keys from the secret keyrings, or just the ones given on the command line. A <span Class="bold">&#35;</span> after the letters <span Class="bold">sec</span> means that the secret key is not usable (for example, if it was created via <span Class="bold">--export-secret-subkeys</span>). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span> Same as <span Class="bold">--list-keys</span>, but the signatures are listed too. 
<p class="level0">For each signature listed, there are several flags in between the "sig" tag and keyid. These flags give additional information about each signature. From left to right, they are the numbers 1-3 for certificate check level (see <span Class="bold">--ask-cert-level</span>), "L" for a local or non-exportable signature (see <span Class="bold">--lsign-key</span>), "R" for a nonRevocable signature (see the <span Class="bold">--edit-key</span> command "nrsign"), "P" for a signature that contains a policy URL (see <span Class="bold">--cert-policy-url</span>), "N" for a signature that contains a notation (see <span Class="bold">--cert-notation</span>), "X" for an eXpired signature (see <span Class="bold">--ask-cert-expire</span>), and the numbers 1-9 or "T" for 10 and above to indicate trust signature levels (see the <span Class="bold">--edit-key</span> command "tsign"). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--check-sigs</span> Same as <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span>, but the signatures are verified.  Note that for performance reasons the revocation status of a signing key is not shown. 
<p class="level0">The status of the verification is indicated by a flag directly following the "sig" tag (and thus before the flags described above for <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span>).  A "!" indicates that the signature has been successfully verified, a "-" denotes a bad signature and a "%" is used if an error occurred while checking the signature (e.g. a non supported algorithm). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--fingerprint</span> List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their fingerprints. This is the same output as <span Class="bold">--list-keys</span> but with the additional output of a line with the fingerprint. May also be combined with <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span> or <span Class="bold">--check-sigs</span>.  If this command is given twice, the fingerprints of all secondary keys are listed too. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--list-packets</span> List only the sequence of packets. This is mainly useful for debugging. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--card-edit</span> Present a menu to work with a smartcard. The subcommand "help" provides an overview on available commands. For a detailed description, please see the Card HOWTO at <a href="https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html&#35;GnuPG-cardHOWTO">https://gnupg.org/documentation/howtos.html&#35;GnuPG-cardHOWTO</a> . 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--card-status</span> Show the content of the smart card. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--change-pin</span> Present a menu to allow changing the PIN of a smartcard. This functionality is also available as the subcommand "passwd" with the <span Class="bold">--card-edit</span> command. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--delete-key \fBname</span> Remove key from the public keyring. In batch mode either <span Class="bold">--yes</span> is required or the key must be specified by fingerprint. This is a safeguard against accidental deletion of multiple keys. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--delete-secret-key \fBname</span> Remove key from the secret keyring. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--delete-secret-and-public-key \fBname</span> Same as <span Class="bold">--delete-key</span>, but if a secret key exists, it will be removed first. In batch mode the key must be specified by fingerprint. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--export</span> Either export all keys from all keyrings (default keyrings and those registered via option <span Class="bold">--keyring</span>), or if at least one name is given, those of the given name. The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option <span Class="bold">--output</span>.  Use together with <span Class="bold">--armor</span> to mail those keys. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--send-keys \fBkey IDs</span> Similar to <span Class="bold">--export</span> but sends the keys to a keyserver. Fingerprints may be used instead of key IDs. Option <span Class="bold">--keyserver</span> must be used to give the name of this keyserver. Don't send your complete keyring to a keyserver --- select only those keys which are new or changed by you.  If no key IDs are given, <span Class="bold">gpg</span> does nothing. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--export-secret-keys</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--export-secret-subkeys</span> Same as <span Class="bold">--export</span>, but exports the secret keys instead.  The exported keys are written to STDOUT or to the file given with option <span Class="bold">--output</span>.  This command is often used along with the option <span Class="bold">--armor</span> to allow easy printing of the key for paper backup; however the external tool <span Class="bold">paperkey</span> does a better job for creating backups on paper.  Note that exporting a secret key can be a security risk if the exported keys are send over an insecure channel. 
<p class="level0">The second form of the command has the special property to render the secret part of the primary key useless; this is a GNU extension to OpenPGP and other implementations can not be expected to successfully import such a key.  Its intended use is to generated a full key with an additional signing subkey on a dedicated machine and then using this command to export the key without the primary key to the main machine. 
<p class="level0">See the option <span Class="bold">--simple-sk-checksum</span> if you want to import an exported secret key into ancient OpenPGP implementations. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--import</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--fast-import</span> Import/merge keys. This adds the given keys to the keyring. The fast version is currently just a synonym. 
<p class="level0">There are a few other options which control how this command works. Most notable here is the <span Class="bold">--import-options merge-only</span> option which does not insert new keys but does only the merging of new signatures, user-IDs and subkeys. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--recv-keys \fBkey IDs</span> Import the keys with the given key IDs from a keyserver. Option <span Class="bold">--keyserver</span> must be used to give the name of this keyserver. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--refresh-keys</span> Request updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist on the local keyring. This is useful for updating a key with the latest signatures, user IDs, etc. Calling this with no arguments will refresh the entire keyring. Option <span Class="bold">--keyserver</span> must be used to give the name of the keyserver for all keys that do not have preferred keyservers set (see <span Class="bold">--keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url</span>). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--search-keys \fBnames</span> Search the keyserver for the given names. Multiple names given here will be joined together to create the search string for the keyserver. Option <span Class="bold">--keyserver</span> must be used to give the name of this keyserver.  Keyservers that support different search methods allow using the syntax specified in "How to specify a user ID" below. Note that different keyserver types support different search methods. Currently only LDAP supports them all. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--fetch-keys \fBURIs</span> Retrieve keys located at the specified URIs. Note that different installations of GnuPG may support different protocols (HTTP, FTP, LDAP, etc.) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--update-trustdb</span> Do trust database maintenance. This command iterates over all keys and builds the Web of Trust. This is an interactive command because it may have to ask for the "ownertrust" values for keys. The user has to give an estimation of how far she trusts the owner of the displayed key to correctly certify (sign) other keys. GnuPG only asks for the ownertrust value if it has not yet been assigned to a key. Using the <span Class="bold">--edit-key</span> menu, the assigned value can be changed at any time. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--check-trustdb</span> Do trust database maintenance without user interaction. From time to time the trust database must be updated so that expired keys or signatures and the resulting changes in the Web of Trust can be tracked. Normally, GnuPG will calculate when this is required and do it automatically unless <span Class="bold">--no-auto-check-trustdb</span> is set. This command can be used to force a trust database check at any time. The processing is identical to that of <span Class="bold">--update-trustdb</span> but it skips keys with a not yet defined "ownertrust". 
<p class="level0">For use with cron jobs, this command can be used together with <span Class="bold">--batch</span> in which case the trust database check is done only if a check is needed. To force a run even in batch mode add the option <span Class="bold">--yes</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--export-ownertrust</span> Send the ownertrust values to STDOUT. This is useful for backup purposes as these values are the only ones which can't be re-created from a corrupted trustdb.  Example: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level2"><pre class="level2">
&nbsp; gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; otrust.txt
</pre>

<p class="level2">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--import-ownertrust</span> Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in <span Class="bold">files</span> (or STDIN if not given); existing values will be overwritten.  In case of a severely damaged trustdb and if you have a recent backup of the ownertrust values (e.g. in the file (oq<span Class="emphasis">otrust.txt</span>(cq, you may re-create the trustdb using these commands: 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level2"><pre class="level2">
&nbsp; cd ~/.gnupg
&nbsp; rm trustdb.gpg
&nbsp; gpg --import-ownertrust &lt; otrust.txt
</pre>

<p class="level2">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--rebuild-keydb-caches</span> When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should be used to create signature caches in the keyring. It might be handy in other situations too. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--print-md \fBalgo</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--print-mds</span> Print message digest of algorithm ALGO for all given files or STDIN. With the second form (or a deprecated "*" as algo) digests for all available algorithms are printed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--gen-random \fB0|1|2 \fBcount</span> Emit <span Class="emphasis">count</span> random bytes of the given quality level 0, 1 or 2. If <span Class="emphasis">count</span> is not given or zero, an endless sequence of random bytes will be emitted.  If used with <span Class="bold">--armor</span> the output will be base64 encoded.  PLEASE, don't use this command unless you know what you are doing; it may remove precious entropy from the system! 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--gen-prime \fBmode  \fBbits</span> Use the source, Luke :-). The output format is still subject to change. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--enarmor</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--dearmor</span> Pack or unpack an arbitrary input into/from an OpenPGP ASCII armor. This is a GnuPG extension to OpenPGP and in general not very useful.

<p class="level0"><a name="How"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">How to manage your keys</h2>
<p class="level0">&nbsp; 
<p class="level0">This section explains the main commands for key management 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--gen-key</span> Generate a new key pair using teh current default parameters.  This is the standard command to create a new key. 
<p class="level0">There is also a feature which allows you to create keys in batch mode. See the the manual section ``Unattended key generation'' on how to use this. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--gen-revoke \fBname</span> Generate a revocation certificate for the complete key. To revoke a subkey or a signature, use the <span Class="bold">--edit</span> command. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--desig-revoke \fBname</span> Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key. This allows a user (with the permission of the keyholder) to revoke someone else's key. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--edit-key</span> Present a menu which enables you to do most of the key management related tasks.  It expects the specification of a key on the command line. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">uid \fBn</span> Toggle selection of user ID or photographic user ID with index <span Class="bold">n</span>. Use <span Class="bold">*</span> to select all and <span Class="bold">0</span> to deselect all. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">key \fBn</span> Toggle selection of subkey with index <span Class="bold">n</span>. Use <span Class="bold">*</span> to select all and <span Class="bold">0</span> to deselect all. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">sign</span> Make a signature on key of user <span Class="bold">name</span> If the key is not yet signed by the default user (or the users given with -u), the program displays the information of the key again, together with its fingerprint and asks whether it should be signed. This question is repeated for all users specified with -u. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">lsign</span> Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-exportable and will therefore never be used by others. This may be used to make keys valid only in the local environment. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">nrsign</span> Same as "sign" but the signature is marked as non-revocable and can therefore never be revoked. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">tsign</span> Make a trust signature. This is a signature that combines the notions of certification (like a regular signature), and trust (like the "trust" command). It is generally only useful in distinct communities or groups. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">Note that "l" (for local / non-exportable), "nr" (for non-revocable, and "t" (for trust) may be freely mixed and prefixed to "sign" to create a signature of any type desired.

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">delsig</span> Delete a signature. Note that it is not possible to retract a signature, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use <span Class="bold">revsig</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">revsig</span> Revoke a signature. For every signature which has been generated by one of the secret keys, GnuPG asks whether a revocation certificate should be generated. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">check</span> Check the signatures on all selected user IDs. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">adduid</span> Create an additional user ID. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">addphoto</span> Create a photographic user ID. This will prompt for a JPEG file that will be embedded into the user ID. Note that a very large JPEG will make for a very large key. Also note that some programs will display your JPEG unchanged (GnuPG), and some programs will scale it to fit in a dialog box (PGP). 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">showphoto</span> Display the selected photographic user ID. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">deluid</span> Delete a user ID or photographic user ID.  Note that it is not possible to retract a user id, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use <span Class="bold">revuid</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">revuid</span> Revoke a user ID or photographic user ID. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">primary</span> Flag the current user id as the primary one, removes the primary user id flag from all other user ids and sets the timestamp of all affected self-signatures one second ahead. Note that setting a photo user ID as primary makes it primary over other photo user IDs, and setting a regular user ID as primary makes it primary over other regular user IDs. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">keyserver</span> Set a preferred keyserver for the specified user ID(s). This allows other users to know where you prefer they get your key from. See <span Class="bold">--keyserver-options honor-keyserver-url</span> for more on how this works.  Setting a value of "none" removes an existing preferred keyserver. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">notation</span> Set a name=value notation for the specified user ID(s). See <span Class="bold">--cert-notation</span> for more on how this works. Setting a value of "none" removes all notations, setting a notation prefixed with a minus sign (-) removes that notation, and setting a notation name (without the =value) prefixed with a minus sign removes all notations with that name. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">pref</span> List preferences from the selected user ID. This shows the actual preferences, without including any implied preferences. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">showpref</span> More verbose preferences listing for the selected user ID. This shows the preferences in effect by including the implied preferences of 3DES (cipher), SHA-1 (digest), and Uncompressed (compression) if they are not already included in the preference list. In addition, the preferred keyserver and signature notations (if any) are shown. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">setpref \fBstring</span> Set the list of user ID preferences to <span Class="bold">string</span> for all (or just the selected) user IDs. Calling setpref with no arguments sets the preference list to the default (either built-in or set via <span Class="bold">--default-preference-list</span>), and calling setpref with "none" as the argument sets an empty preference list. Use <span class="bold">gpg --version</span> to get a list of available algorithms. Note that while you can change the preferences on an attribute user ID (aka "photo ID"), GnuPG does not select keys via attribute user IDs so these preferences will not be used by GnuPG. 
<p class="level1">When setting preferences, you should list the algorithms in the order which you'd like to see them used by someone else when encrypting a message to your key.  If you don't include 3DES, it will be automatically added at the end.  Note that there are many factors that go into choosing an algorithm (for example, your key may not be the only recipient), and so the remote OpenPGP application being used to send to you may or may not follow your exact chosen order for a given message.  It will, however, only choose an algorithm that is present on the preference list of every recipient key.  See also the INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER OPENPGP PROGRAMS section below. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">addkey</span> Add a subkey to this key. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">addcardkey</span> Generate a subkey on a card and add it to this key. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">keytocard</span> Transfer the selected secret subkey (or the primary key if no subkey has been selected) to a smartcard. The secret key in the keyring will be replaced by a stub if the key could be stored successfully on the card and you use the save command later. Only certain key types may be transferred to the card. A sub menu allows you to select on what card to store the key. Note that it is not possible to get that key back from the card - if the card gets broken your secret key will be lost unless you have a backup somewhere. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">bkuptocard \fBfile</span> Restore the given file to a card. This command may be used to restore a backup key (as generated during card initialization) to a new card. In almost all cases this will be the encryption key. You should use this command only with the corresponding public key and make sure that the file given as argument is indeed the backup to restore. You should then select 2 to restore as encryption key.  You will first be asked to enter the passphrase of the backup key and then for the Admin PIN of the card. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">delkey</span> Remove a subkey (secondart key). Note that it is not possible to retract a subkey, once it has been send to the public (i.e. to a keyserver).  In that case you better use <span Class="bold">revkey</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">revkey</span> Revoke a subkey. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">expire</span> Change the key or subkey expiration time. If a subkey is selected, the expiration time of this subkey will be changed. With no selection, the key expiration of the primary key is changed. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">trust</span> Change the owner trust value for the key. This updates the trust-db immediately and no save is required. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">disable</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">enable</span> Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can not normally be used for encryption. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">addrevoker</span> Add a designated revoker to the key. This takes one optional argument: "sensitive". If a designated revoker is marked as sensitive, it will not be exported by default (see export-options). 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">passwd</span> Change the passphrase of the secret key. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">toggle</span> Toggle between public and secret key listing. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">clean</span> Compact (by removing all signatures except the selfsig) any user ID that is no longer usable (e.g. revoked, or expired). Then, remove any signatures that are not usable by the trust calculations. Specifically, this removes any signature that does not validate, any signature that is superseded by a later signature, revoked signatures, and signatures issued by keys that are not present on the keyring. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">minimize</span> Make the key as small as possible. This removes all signatures from each user ID except for the most recent self-signature. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">cross-certify</span> Add cross-certification signatures to signing subkeys that may not currently have them. Cross-certification signatures protect against a subtle attack against signing subkeys. See <span Class="bold">--require-cross-certification</span>.  All new keys generated have this signature by default, so this option is only useful to bring older keys up to date. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">save</span> Save all changes to the key rings and quit. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">quit</span> Quit the program without updating the key rings. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">The listing shows you the key with its secondary keys and all user ids.  The primary user id is indicated by a dot, and selected keys or user ids are indicated by an asterisk.  The trust value is displayed with the primary key: the first is the assigned owner trust and the second is the calculated trust value. Letters are used for the values: 
<p class="level0">

<p class="level0"><a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">gpg</span> features a bunch of options to control the exact behaviour and to change the default configuration. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">Long options can be put in an options file (default "~/.gnupg/gpg.conf"). Short option names will not work - for example, "armor" is a valid option for the options file, while "a" is not. Do not write the 2 dashes, but simply the name of the option and any required arguments. Lines with a hash ('&#35;') as the first non-white-space character are ignored. Commands may be put in this file too, but that is not generally useful as the command will execute automatically with every execution of gpg. 
<p class="level0">Please remember that option parsing stops as soon as a non-option is encountered, you can explicitly stop parsing by using the special option <span Class="bold">--</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><a name="How"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">How to change the configuration</h2>
<p class="level0">&nbsp; 
<p class="level0">These options are used to change the configuration and are usually found in the option file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--default-key name</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">name</span> as the default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is the first key found in the secret keyring. Note that <span Class="bold">-u</span> or <span Class="bold">--local-user</span> overrides this option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--default-recipient name</span> Use <span Class="emphasis">name</span> as default recipient if option <span Class="bold">--recipient</span> is not used and don't ask if this is a valid one. <span Class="emphasis">name</span> must be non-empty. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--default-recipient-self</span> Use the default key as default recipient if option <span Class="bold">--recipient</span> is not used and don't ask if this is a valid one. The default key is the first one from the secret keyring or the one set with <span Class="bold">--default-key</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-default-recipient</span> Reset <span Class="bold">--default-recipient</span> and <span Class="bold">--default-recipient-self</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-v, --verbose</span> Give more information during processing. If used twice, the input data is listed in detail. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-verbose</span> Reset verbose level to 0. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-q, --quiet</span> Try to be as quiet as possible. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--batch</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-batch</span> Use batch mode.  Never ask, do not allow interactive commands. <span Class="bold">--no-batch</span> disables this option.  This option is commonly used for unattended operations. 
<p class="level0">WARNING: Unattended operation bears a higher risk of being exposed to security attacks.  In particular any unattended use of GnuPG which involves the use of secret keys should take care not to provide an decryption oracle.  There are several standard pre-cautions against being used as an oracle.  For example never return detailed error messages or any diagnostics printed by your software to the remote site.  Consult with an expert in case of doubt. 
<p class="level0">Note that even with a filename given on the command line, gpg might still need to read from STDIN (in particular if gpg figures that the input is a detached signature and no data file has been specified). Thus if you do not want to feed data via STDIN, you should connect STDIN to (oq<span Class="emphasis">/dev/null</span>(cq. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-tty</span> Make sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any output. This option is needed in some cases because GnuPG sometimes prints warnings to the TTY even if <span Class="bold">--batch</span> is used. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--yes</span> Assume "yes" on most questions. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no</span> Assume "no" on most questions.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--list-options \fBparameters</span> This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when listing keys and signatures (that is, <span Class="bold">--list-keys</span>, <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span>, <span Class="bold">--list-public-keys</span>, <span Class="bold">--list-secret-keys</span>, and the <span Class="bold">--edit-key</span> functions). Options can be prepended with a <span Class="bold">no-</span> (after the two dashes) to give the opposite meaning.  The options are: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-photos</span> Causes <span Class="bold">--list-keys</span>, <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span>, <span Class="bold">--list-public-keys</span>, and <span Class="bold">--list-secret-keys</span> to display any photo IDs attached to the key.  Defaults to no. See also <span Class="bold">--photo-viewer</span>.  Does not work with <span Class="bold">--with-colons</span>: see <span Class="bold">--attribute-fd</span> for the appropriate way to get photo data for scripts and other frontends. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-usage</span> Show usage information for keys and subkeys in the standard key listing.  This is a list of letters indicating the allowed usage for a key (<span Class="bold">E</span>=encryption, <span Class="bold">S</span>=signing, <span Class="bold">C</span>=certification, <span Class="bold">A</span>=authentication).  Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-policy-urls</span> Show policy URLs in the <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span> or <span Class="bold">--check-sigs</span> listings.  Defaults to no.

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-notations</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-std-notations</span> 
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-user-notations</span> Show all, IETF standard, or user-defined signature notations in the <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span> or <span Class="bold">--check-sigs</span> listings. Defaults to no.

<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-sig-expire</span> Show signature expiration dates (if any) during <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span> or <span Class="bold">--check-sigs</span> listings. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-sig-subpackets</span> Include signature subpackets in the key listing. This option can take an optional argument list of the subpackets to list. If no argument is passed, list all subpackets. Defaults to no. This option is only meaningful when using <span Class="bold">--with-colons</span> along with <span Class="bold">--list-sigs</span> or <span Class="bold">--check-sigs</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--verify-options \fBparameters</span> This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options used when verifying signatures. Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning. The options are:

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-photos</span> Display any photo IDs present on the key that issued the signature. Defaults to no. See also <span Class="bold">--photo-viewer</span>.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-keyserver-urls</span> Show any preferred keyserver URL in the signature being verified. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-uid-validity</span> Display the calculated validity of the user IDs on the key that issued the signature. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-unusable-uids</span> Show revoked and expired user IDs during signature verification. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">show-primary-uid-only</span> Show only the primary user ID during signature verification.  That is all the AKA lines as well as photo Ids are not shown with the signature verification status. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">pka-lookups</span> Enable PKA lookups to verify sender addresses. Note that PKA is based on DNS, and so enabling this option may disclose information on when and what signatures are verified or to whom data is encrypted. This is similar to the "web bug" described for the auto-key-retrieve feature. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">pka-trust-increase</span> Raise the trust in a signature to full if the signature passes PKA validation. This option is only meaningful if pka-lookups is set. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--enable-large-rsa</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--disable-large-rsa</span> With --gen-key and --batch, enable the creation of larger RSA secret keys than is generally recommended (up to 8192 bits).  These large keys are more expensive to use, and their signatures and certifications are also larger. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--enable-dsa2</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--disable-dsa2</span> Enable hash truncation for all DSA keys even for old DSA Keys up to 1024 bit.  This is also the default with <span Class="bold">--openpgp</span>.  Note that older versions of GnuPG also required this flag to allow the generation of DSA larger than 1024 bit. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--photo-viewer \fBstring</span> This is the command line that should be run to view a photo ID. "%i" will be expanded to a filename containing the photo. "%I" does the same, except the file will not be deleted once the viewer exits. Other flags are "%k" for the key ID, "%K" for the long key ID, "%f" for the key fingerprint, "%t" for the extension of the image type (e.g. "jpg"), "%T" for the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg"), "%v" for the single-character calculated validity of the image being viewed (e.g. "f"), "%V" for the calculated validity as a string (e.g. "full"), "%U" for a base32 encoded hash of the user ID, and "%%" for an actual percent sign. If neither %i or %I are present, then the photo will be supplied to the viewer on standard input. 
<p class="level0">The default viewer is "xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID 0x%k' STDIN". Note that if your image viewer program is not secure, then executing it from GnuPG does not make it secure. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--exec-path \fBstring</span> Sets a list of directories to search for photo viewers and keyserver helpers. If not provided, keyserver helpers use the compiled-in default directory, and photo viewers use the $PATH environment variable. Note, that on W32 system this value is ignored when searching for keyserver helpers. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--keyring \fBfile</span> Add <span Class="bold">file</span> to the current list of keyrings. If <span Class="bold">file</span> begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory ("~/.gnupg" if <span Class="bold">--homedir</span> or $GNUPGHOME is not used). 
<p class="level0">Note that this adds a keyring to the current list. If the intent is to use the specified keyring alone, use <span Class="bold">--keyring</span> along with <span Class="bold">--no-default-keyring</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--secret-keyring \fBfile</span> Same as <span Class="bold">--keyring</span> but for the secret keyrings. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--primary-keyring \fBfile</span> Designate <span Class="bold">file</span> as the primary public keyring. This means that newly imported keys (via <span Class="bold">--import</span> or keyserver <span Class="bold">--recv-from</span>) will go to this keyring. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--trustdb-name \fBfile</span> Use <span Class="bold">file</span> instead of the default trustdb. If <span Class="bold">file</span> begins with a tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the $HOME directory. If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be in the GnuPG home directory ((oq<span Class="emphasis">~/.gnupg</span>(cq if <span Class="bold">--homedir</span> or $GNUPGHOME is not used). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--homedir dir</span> Set the name of the home directory to <span Class="emphasis">dir</span>. If this option is not used, the home directory defaults to (oq<span Class="emphasis">~/.gnupg</span>(cq.  It is only recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home directory stated through the environment variable (oq<span Class="emphasis">GNUPGHOME</span>(cq or (on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry <span Class="emphasis">HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</span>. 
<p class="level0">On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable application.  In this case only this command line option is considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored. 
<p class="level0">To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create an empty file name (oq<span Class="emphasis">gpgconf.ctl</span>(cq in the same directory as the tool (oq<span Class="emphasis">gpgconf.exe</span>(cq.  The root of the installation is than that directory; or, if (oq<span Class="emphasis">gpgconf.exe</span>(cq has been installed directly below a directory named (oq<span Class="emphasis">bin</span>(cq, its parent directory.  You also need to make sure that the following directories exist and are writable: (oq<span Class="emphasis">ROOT/home</span>(cq for the GnuPG home and (oq<span Class="emphasis">ROOT/var/cache/gnupg</span>(cq for internal cache files. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--pcsc-driver \fBfile</span> Use <span Class="bold">file</span> to access the smartcard reader. The current default is `libpcsclite.so.1' for GLIBC based systems, `/System/Library/Frameworks/PCSC.framework/PCSC' for MAC OS X, `winscard.dll' for Windows and `libpcsclite.so' for other systems. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--disable-ccid</span> Disable the integrated support for CCID compliant readers. This allows to fall back to one of the other drivers even if the internal CCID driver can handle the reader. Note, that CCID support is only available if libusb was available at build time. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--reader-port \fBnumber_or_string</span> This option may be used to specify the port of the card terminal. A value of 0 refers to the first serial device; add 32768 to access USB devices. The default is 32768 (first USB device). PC/SC or CCID readers might need a string here; run the program in verbose mode to get a list of available readers. The default is then the first reader found. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--display-charset \fBname</span> Set the name of the native character set. This is used to convert some informational strings like user IDs to the proper UTF-8 encoding. Note that this has nothing to do with the character set of data to be encrypted or signed; GnuPG does not recode user-supplied data. If this option is not used, the default character set is determined from the current locale. A verbosity level of 3 shows the chosen set. Valid values for <span Class="bold">name</span> are:

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--compress-level \fBn</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--bzip2-compress-level \fBn</span> Set compression level to <span Class="bold">n</span> for the ZIP and ZLIB compression algorithms. The default is to use the default compression level of zlib (normally 6). <span Class="bold">--bzip2-compress-level</span> sets the compression level for the BZIP2 compression algorithm (defaulting to 6 as well). This is a different option from <span Class="bold">--compress-level</span> since BZIP2 uses a significant amount of memory for each additional compression level. <span Class="bold">-z</span> sets both.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--ask-cert-level</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-ask-cert-level</span> When making a key signature, prompt for a certification level. If this option is not specified, the certification level used is set via <span Class="bold">--default-cert-level</span>. See <span Class="bold">--default-cert-level</span> for information on the specific levels and how they are used. <span Class="bold">--no-ask-cert-level</span> disables this option. This option defaults to no. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--default-cert-level \fBn</span> The default to use for the check level when signing a key. 
<p class="level0">0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully you verified the key. 
<p class="level0">1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims to own it but you could not, or did not verify the key at all. This is useful for a "persona" verification, where you sign the key of a pseudonymous user. 
<p class="level0">2 means you did casual verification of the key. For example, this could mean that you verified the key fingerprint and checked the user ID on the key against a photo ID. 
<p class="level0">3 means you did extensive verification of the key. For example, this could mean that you verified the key fingerprint with the owner of the key in person, and that you checked, by means of a hard to forge document with a photo ID (such as a passport) that the name of the key owner matches the name in the user ID on the key, and finally that you verified (by exchange of email) that the email address on the key belongs to the key owner. 
<p class="level0">Note that the examples given above for levels 2 and 3 are just that: examples. In the end, it is up to you to decide just what "casual" and "extensive" mean to you. 
<p class="level0">This option defaults to 0 (no particular claim). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--min-cert-level</span> When building the trust database, treat any signatures with a certification level below this as invalid. Defaults to 2, which disregards level 1 signatures. Note that level 0 "no particular claim" signatures are always accepted. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--trusted-key \fBlong key ID</span> Assume that the specified key (which must be given as a full 8 byte key ID) is as trustworthy as one of your own secret keys. This option is useful if you don't want to keep your secret keys (or one of them) online but still want to be able to check the validity of a given recipient's or signator's key. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--trust-model \fBpgp|classic|direct|always|auto</span> Set what trust model GnuPG should follow. The models are: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">pgp</span> This is the Web of Trust combined with trust signatures as used in PGP 5.x and later. This is the default trust model when creating a new trust database. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">classic</span> This is the standard Web of Trust as introduced by PGP 2. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">direct</span> Key validity is set directly by the user and not calculated via the Web of Trust. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">always</span> Skip key validation and assume that used keys are always fully valid. You generally won't use this unless you are using some external validation scheme. This option also suppresses the "[uncertain]" tag printed with signature checks when there is no evidence that the user ID is bound to the key.  Note that this trust model still does not allow the use of expired, revoked, or disabled keys. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">auto</span> Select the trust model depending on whatever the internal trust database says. This is the default model if such a database already exists. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--auto-key-locate \fBparameters</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-auto-key-locate</span> GnuPG can automatically locate and retrieve keys as needed using this option. This happens when encrypting to an email address (in the "user@example.com" form), and there are no user@example.com keys on the local keyring.  This option takes any number of the following mechanisms, in the order they are to be tried: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">cert</span> Locate a key using DNS CERT, as specified in rfc4398. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">pka</span> Locate a key using DNS PKA. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">ldap</span> Using DNS Service Discovery, check the domain in question for any LDAP keyservers to use.  If this fails, attempt to locate the key using the PGP Universal method of checking (aqldap://keys.(thedomain)(aq. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">keyserver</span> Locate a key using whatever keyserver is defined using the <span Class="bold">--keyserver</span> option. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">keyserver-URL</span> In addition, a keyserver URL as used in the <span Class="bold">--keyserver</span> option may be used here to query that particular keyserver. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">local</span> Locate the key using the local keyrings.  This mechanism allows to select the order a local key lookup is done.  Thus using (aq--auto-key-locate local(aq is identical to <span Class="bold">--no-auto-key-locate</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">nodefault</span> This flag disables the standard local key lookup, done before any of the mechanisms defined by the <span Class="bold">--auto-key-locate</span> are tried.  The position of this mechanism in the list does not matter.  It is not required if <span Class="bold">local</span> is also used. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">clear</span> Clear all defined mechanisms.  This is useful to override mechanisms given in a config file. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--keyid-format \fBshort|0xshort|long|0xlong</span> Select how to display key IDs. "short" is the traditional 8-character key ID. "long" is the more accurate (but less convenient) 16-character key ID. Add an "0x" to either to include an "0x" at the beginning of the key ID, as in 0x99242560.  Note that this option is ignored if the option --with-colons is used. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--keyserver \fBname</span> Use <span Class="bold">name</span> as your keyserver. This is the server that <span Class="bold">--recv-keys</span>, <span Class="bold">--send-keys</span>, and <span Class="bold">--search-keys</span> will communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on. The format of the <span Class="bold">name</span> is a URI: `scheme:[//]keyservername[:port]' The scheme is the type of keyserver: "hkp" for the HTTP (or compatible) keyservers, "ldap" for the LDAP keyservers, or "mailto" for the Graff email keyserver. Note that your particular installation of GnuPG may have other keyserver types available as well. Keyserver schemes are case-insensitive. After the keyserver name, optional keyserver configuration options may be provided. These are the same as the global <span Class="bold">--keyserver-options</span> from below, but apply only to this particular keyserver. 
<p class="level0">Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is generally no need to send keys to more than one server. The keyserver <span Class="bold">hkp://keys.gnupg.net</span> uses round robin DNS to give a different keyserver each time you use it. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--keyserver-options \fBname=value1 </span> This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for the keyserver. Options can be prefixed with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning. Valid import-options or export-options may be used here as well to apply to importing (<span Class="bold">--recv-key</span>) or exporting (<span Class="bold">--send-key</span>) a key from a keyserver. While not all options are available for all keyserver types, some common options are: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">include-revoked</span> When searching for a key with <span Class="bold">--search-keys</span>, include keys that are marked on the keyserver as revoked. Note that not all keyservers differentiate between revoked and unrevoked keys, and for such keyservers this option is meaningless. Note also that most keyservers do not have cryptographic verification of key revocations, and so turning this option off may result in skipping keys that are incorrectly marked as revoked. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">include-disabled</span> When searching for a key with <span Class="bold">--search-keys</span>, include keys that are marked on the keyserver as disabled. Note that this option is not used with HKP keyservers. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">auto-key-retrieve</span> This option enables the automatic retrieving of keys from a keyserver when verifying signatures made by keys that are not on the local keyring. 
<p class="level1">Note that this option makes a "web bug" like behavior possible. Keyserver operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you a message signed by a brand new key (which you naturally will not have on your local keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and the time when you verified the signature. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">honor-keyserver-url</span> When using <span Class="bold">--refresh-keys</span>, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from. In addition, if auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature being verified has a preferred keyserver URL, then use that preferred keyserver to fetch the key from. Defaults to yes. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">honor-pka-record</span> If auto-key-retrieve is set, and the signature being verified has a PKA record, then use the PKA information to fetch the key. Defaults to yes. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">include-subkeys</span> When receiving a key, include subkeys as potential targets. Note that this option is not used with HKP keyservers, as they do not support retrieving keys by subkey id. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">use-temp-files</span> On most Unix-like platforms, GnuPG communicates with the keyserver helper program via pipes, which is the most efficient method. This option forces GnuPG to use temporary files to communicate. On some platforms (such as Win32 and RISC OS), this option is always enabled. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">keep-temp-files</span> If using `use-temp-files', do not delete the temp files after using them. This option is useful to learn the keyserver communication protocol by reading the temporary files. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">verbose</span> Tell the keyserver helper program to be more verbose. This option can be repeated multiple times to increase the verbosity level. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">timeout</span> Tell the keyserver helper program how long (in seconds) to try and perform a keyserver action before giving up. Note that performing multiple actions at the same time uses this timeout value per action. For example, when retrieving multiple keys via <span Class="bold">--recv-keys</span>, the timeout applies separately to each key retrieval, and not to the <span Class="bold">--recv-keys</span> command as a whole. Defaults to 30 seconds. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">http-proxy=\fBvalue</span> Set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP keyservers.  This overrides the "http_proxy" environment variable, if any. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">max-cert-size</span> When retrieving a key via DNS CERT, only accept keys up to this size. Defaults to 16384 bytes. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">debug</span> Turn on debug output in the keyserver helper program.  Note that the details of debug output depends on which keyserver helper program is being used, and in turn, on any libraries that the keyserver helper program uses internally (libcurl, openldap, etc). 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">check-cert</span> Enable certificate checking if the keyserver presents one (for hkps or ldaps).  Defaults to on. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">ca-cert-file</span> Provide a certificate store to override the system default.  Only necessary if check-cert is enabled, and the keyserver is using a certificate that is not present in a system default certificate list. 
<p class="level1">Note that depending on the SSL library that the keyserver helper is built with, this may actually be a directory or a file. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--completes-needed \fBn</span> Number of completely trusted users to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 1). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--marginals-needed \fBn</span> Number of marginally trusted users to introduce a new key signer (defaults to 3) 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--max-cert-depth \fBn</span> Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--simple-sk-checksum</span> Secret keys are integrity protected by using a SHA-1 checksum. This method is part of the upcoming enhanced OpenPGP specification but GnuPG already uses it as a countermeasure against certain attacks. Old applications don't understand this new format, so this option may be used to switch back to the old behaviour. Using this option bears a security risk. Note that using this option only takes effect when the secret key is encrypted - the simplest way to make this happen is to change the passphrase on the key (even changing it to the same value is acceptable). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-sig-cache</span> Do not cache the verification status of key signatures. Caching gives a much better performance in key listings. However, if you suspect that your public keyring is not save against write modifications, you can use this option to disable the caching. It probably does not make sense to disable it because all kind of damage can be done if someone else has write access to your public keyring. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-sig-create-check</span> GnuPG normally verifies each signature right after creation to protect against bugs and hardware malfunctions which could leak out bits from the secret key. This extra verification needs some time (about 115% for DSA keys), and so this option can be used to disable it. However, due to the fact that the signature creation needs manual interaction, this performance penalty does not matter in most settings. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--auto-check-trustdb</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-auto-check-trustdb</span> If GnuPG feels that its information about the Web of Trust has to be updated, it automatically runs the <span Class="bold">--check-trustdb</span> command internally.  This may be a time consuming process. <span Class="bold">--no-auto-check-trustdb</span> disables this option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--use-agent</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-use-agent</span> Try to use the GnuPG-Agent.  With this option, GnuPG first tries to connect to the agent before it asks for a passphrase. <span Class="bold">--no-use-agent</span> disables this option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--gpg-agent-info</span> Override the value of the environment variable (aqGPG_AGENT_INFO(aq. This is only used when <span Class="bold">--use-agent</span> has been given.  Given that this option is not anymore used by <span Class="bold">gpg2</span>, it should be avoided if possible. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--lock-once</span> Lock the databases the first time a lock is requested and do not release the lock until the process terminates. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--lock-multiple</span> Release the locks every time a lock is no longer needed. Use this to override a previous <span Class="bold">--lock-once</span> from a config file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--lock-never</span> Disable locking entirely. This option should be used only in very special environments, where it can be assured that only one process is accessing those files. A bootable floppy with a stand-alone encryption system will probably use this. Improper usage of this option may lead to data and key corruption. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--exit-on-status-write-error</span> This option will cause write errors on the status FD to immediately terminate the process. That should in fact be the default but it never worked this way and thus we need an option to enable this, so that the change won't break applications which close their end of a status fd connected pipe too early. Using this option along with <span Class="bold">--enable-progress-filter</span> may be used to cleanly cancel long running gpg operations. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--limit-card-insert-tries \fBn</span> With <span Class="bold">n</span> greater than 0 the number of prompts asking to insert a smartcard gets limited to N-1. Thus with a value of 1 gpg won't at all ask to insert a card if none has been inserted at startup. This option is useful in the configuration file in case an application does not know about the smartcard support and waits ad infinitum for an inserted card. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-random-seed-file</span> GnuPG uses a file to store its internal random pool over invocations. This makes random generation faster; however sometimes write operations are not desired. This option can be used to achieve that with the cost of slower random generation. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-greeting</span> Suppress the initial copyright message. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-secmem-warning</span> Suppress the warning about "using insecure memory". 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-permission-warning</span> Suppress the warning about unsafe file and home directory (<span Class="bold">--homedir</span>) permissions. Note that the permission checks that GnuPG performs are not intended to be authoritative, but rather they simply warn about certain common permission problems. Do not assume that the lack of a warning means that your system is secure. 
<p class="level0">Note that the warning for unsafe <span Class="bold">--homedir</span> permissions cannot be suppressed in the gpg.conf file, as this would allow an attacker to place an unsafe gpg.conf file in place, and use this file to suppress warnings about itself. The <span Class="bold">--homedir</span> permissions warning may only be suppressed on the command line. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-mdc-warning</span> Suppress the warning about missing MDC integrity protection. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--require-secmem</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-require-secmem</span> Refuse to run if GnuPG cannot get secure memory. Defaults to no (i.e. run, but give a warning). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--require-cross-certification</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-require-cross-certification</span> When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and valid.  This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign. Defaults to <span Class="bold">--require-cross-certification</span> for <span Class="bold">gpg</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--expert</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-expert</span> Allow the user to do certain nonsensical or "silly" things like signing an expired or revoked key, or certain potentially incompatible things like generating unusual key types. This also disables certain warning messages about potentially incompatible actions. As the name implies, this option is for experts only. If you don't fully understand the implications of what it allows you to do, leave this off. <span Class="bold">--no-expert</span> disables this option.

Any time the group name is a recipient (<span Class="bold">-r</span> or <span Class="bold">--recipient</span>), it will be expanded to the values specified. Multiple groups with the same name are automatically merged into a single group. 
<p class="level0">The values are <span Class="bold">key IDs</span> or fingerprints, but any key description is accepted. Note that a value with spaces in it will be treated as two different values.

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-skip-hidden-recipients</span> During decryption skip all anonymous recipients.  This option helps in the case that people use the hidden recipients feature to hide there own encrypt-to key from others.  If oneself has many secret keys this may lead to a major annoyance because all keys are tried in turn to decrypt soemthing which was not really intended for it.  The drawback of this option is that it is currently not possible to decrypt a message which includes real anonymous recipients.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--max-output \fBn</span> This option sets a limit on the number of bytes that will be generated when processing a file. Since OpenPGP supports various levels of compression, it is possible that the plaintext of a given message may be significantly larger than the original OpenPGP message. While GnuPG works properly with such messages, there is often a desire to set a maximum file size that will be generated before processing is forced to stop by the OS limits. Defaults to 0, which means "no limit". 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--import-options \fBparameters</span> This is a space or comma delimited string that gives options for importing keys. Options can be prepended with a `no-' to give the opposite meaning. The options are: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">import-local-sigs</span> Allow importing key signatures marked as "local". This is not generally useful unless a shared keyring scheme is being used. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">repair-pks-subkey-bug</span> During import, attempt to repair the damage caused by the PKS keyserver bug (pre version 0.9.6) that mangles keys with multiple subkeys. Note that this cannot completely repair the damaged key as some crucial data is removed by the keyserver, but it does at least give you back one subkey. Defaults to no for regular <span Class="bold">--import</span> and to yes for keyserver <span Class="bold">--recv-keys</span>. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">merge-only</span> During import, allow key updates to existing keys, but do not allow any new keys to be imported. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">import-clean</span> After import, compact (remove all signatures except the self-signature) any user IDs from the new key that are not usable. Then, remove any signatures from the new key that are not usable. This includes signatures that were issued by keys that are not present on the keyring. This option is the same as running the <span Class="bold">--edit-key</span> command "clean" after import. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">import-minimal</span> Import the smallest key possible. This removes all signatures except the most recent self-signature on each user ID.

<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">export-attributes</span> Include attribute user IDs (photo IDs) while exporting. This is useful to export keys if they are going to be used by an OpenPGP program that does not accept attribute user IDs. Defaults to yes. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">export-sensitive-revkeys</span> Include designated revoker information that was marked as "sensitive". Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">export-reset-subkey-passwd</span> When using the <span Class="bold">--export-secret-subkeys</span> command, this option resets the passphrases for all exported subkeys to empty. This is useful when the exported subkey is to be used on an unattended machine where a passphrase doesn't necessarily make sense. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">export-clean</span> Compact (remove all signatures from) user IDs on the key being exported if the user IDs are not usable. Also, do not export any signatures that are not usable. This includes signatures that were issued by keys that are not present on the keyring. This option is the same as running the <span Class="bold">--edit-key</span> command "clean" before export except that the local copy of the key is not modified. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level1">
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">export-minimal</span> Export the smallest key possible. This removes all signatures except the most recent self-signature on each user ID.

Note that the output will be encoded in UTF-8 regardless of any <span Class="bold">--display-charset</span> setting. This format is useful when GnuPG is called from scripts and other programs as it is easily machine parsed. The details of this format are documented in the file (oq<span Class="emphasis">doc/DETAILS</span>(cq, which is included in the GnuPG source distribution. 
<p class="level0">

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">-t, --textmode</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-textmode</span> Treat input files as text and store them in the OpenPGP canonical text form with standard "CRLF" line endings. This also sets the necessary flags to inform the recipient that the encrypted or signed data is text and may need its line endings converted back to whatever the local system uses. This option is useful when communicating between two platforms that have different line ending conventions (UNIX-like to Mac, Mac to Windows, etc). <span Class="bold">--no-textmode</span> disables this option, and is the default. 
<p class="level0">If <span Class="bold">-t</span> (but not <span Class="bold">--textmode</span>) is used together with armoring and signing, this enables clearsigned messages. This kludge is needed for command-line compatibility with command-line versions of PGP; normally you would use <span Class="bold">--sign</span> or <span Class="bold">--clearsign</span> to select the type of the signature. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--force-v3-sigs</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-force-v3-sigs</span> OpenPGP states that an implementation should generate v4 signatures but PGP versions 5 through 7 only recognize v4 signatures on key material. This option forces v3 signatures for signatures on data. Note that this option implies <span Class="bold">--no-ask-sig-expire</span>, and unsets <span Class="bold">--sig-policy-url</span>, <span Class="bold">--sig-notation</span>, and <span Class="bold">--sig-keyserver-url</span>, as these features cannot be used with v3 signatures.  <span Class="bold">--no-force-v3-sigs</span> disables this option. Defaults to no. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--force-v4-certs</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-force-v4-certs</span> Always use v4 key signatures even on v3 keys. This option also changes the default hash algorithm for v3 RSA keys from MD5 to SHA-1. <span Class="bold">--no-force-v4-certs</span> disables this option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--force-mdc</span> Force the use of encryption with a modification detection code. This is always used with the newer ciphers (those with a blocksize greater than 64 bits), or if all of the recipient keys indicate MDC support in their feature flags. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--disable-mdc</span> Disable the use of the modification detection code. Note that by using this option, the encrypted message becomes vulnerable to a message modification attack. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--personal-cipher-preferences \fBstring</span> Set the list of personal cipher preferences to <span Class="bold">string</span>.  Use <span Class="bold">gpg --version</span> to get a list of available algorithms, and use <span Class="bold">none</span> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked cipher in this list is also used for the <span Class="bold">--symmetric</span> encryption command. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--personal-digest-preferences \fBstring</span> Set the list of personal digest preferences to <span Class="bold">string</span>.  Use <span Class="bold">gpg --version</span> to get a list of available algorithms, and use <span Class="bold">none</span> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked digest algorithm in this list is also used when signing without encryption (e.g. <span Class="bold">--clearsign</span> or <span Class="bold">--sign</span>). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--personal-compress-preferences \fBstring</span> Set the list of personal compression preferences to <span Class="bold">string</span>. Use <span Class="bold">gpg --version</span> to get a list of available algorithms, and use <span Class="bold">none</span> to set no preference at all.  This allows the user to safely override the algorithm chosen by the recipient key preferences, as GPG will only select an algorithm that is usable by all recipients.  The most highly ranked compression algorithm in this list is also used when there are no recipient keys to consider (e.g. <span Class="bold">--symmetric</span>). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--s2k-cipher-algo \fBname</span> Use <span Class="bold">name</span> as the cipher algorithm used to protect secret keys. The default cipher is CAST5. This cipher is also used for conventional encryption if <span Class="bold">--personal-cipher-preferences</span> and <span Class="bold">--cipher-algo</span> is not given. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--s2k-digest-algo \fBname</span> Use <span Class="bold">name</span> as the digest algorithm used to mangle the passphrases. The default algorithm is SHA-1. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--s2k-mode \fBn</span> Selects how passphrases are mangled. If <span Class="bold">n</span> is 0 a plain passphrase (which is not recommended) will be used, a 1 adds a salt to the passphrase and a 3 (the default) iterates the whole process a number of times (see --s2k-count).  Unless <span Class="bold">--rfc1991</span> is used, this mode is also used for conventional encryption. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--s2k-count \fBn</span> Specify how many times the passphrase mangling is repeated.  This value may range between 1024 and 65011712 inclusive.  The default is inquired from gpg-agent.  Note that not all values in the 1024-65011712 range are legal and if an illegal value is selected, GnuPG will round up to the nearest legal value.  This option is only meaningful if <span Class="bold">--s2k-mode</span> is 3.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--gnupg</span> Use standard GnuPG behavior. This is essentially OpenPGP behavior (see <span Class="bold">--openpgp</span>), but with some additional workarounds for common compatibility problems in different versions of PGP. This is the default option, so it is not generally needed, but it may be useful to override a different compliance option in the gpg.conf file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--openpgp</span> Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict OpenPGP behavior. Use this option to reset all previous options like <span Class="bold">--s2k-*</span>, <span Class="bold">--cipher-algo</span>, <span Class="bold">--digest-algo</span> and <span Class="bold">--compress-algo</span> to OpenPGP compliant values. All PGP workarounds are disabled. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--rfc4880</span> Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-4880 behavior. Note that this is currently the same thing as <span Class="bold">--openpgp</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--rfc2440</span> Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to strict RFC-2440 behavior. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--rfc1991</span> Try to be more RFC-1991 (PGP 2.x) compliant.  This option is deprecated will be removed in GnuPG 2.1. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--pgp2</span> Set up all options to be as PGP 2.x compliant as possible, and warn if an action is taken (e.g. encrypting to a non-RSA key) that will create a message that PGP 2.x will not be able to handle. Note that `PGP 2.x' here means `MIT PGP 2.6.2'. There are other versions of PGP 2.x available, but the MIT release is a good common baseline. 
<p class="level0">This option implies <span class="bold">--rfc1991 --disable-mdc --no-force-v4-certs &nbsp;--escape-from-lines  --force-v3-sigs &nbsp;--cipher-algo IDEA --digest-algo MD5 --compress-algo ZIP</span>. It also disables <span Class="bold">--textmode</span> when encrypting. 
<p class="level0">This option is deprecated will be removed in GnuPG 2.1.  The reason for dropping PGP-2 support is that the PGP 2 format is not anymore considered safe (for example due to the use of the broken MD5 algorithm). Note that the decryption of PGP-2 created messages will continue to work. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--pgp6</span> Set up all options to be as PGP 6 compliant as possible. This restricts you to the ciphers IDEA (if the IDEA plugin is installed), 3DES, and CAST5, the hashes MD5, SHA1 and RIPEMD160, and the compression algorithms none and ZIP. This also disables --throw-keyids, and making signatures with signing subkeys as PGP 6 does not understand signatures made by signing subkeys. 
<p class="level0">This option implies <span class="bold">--disable-mdc --escape-from-lines --force-v3-sigs</span>. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--pgp7</span> Set up all options to be as PGP 7 compliant as possible. This is identical to <span Class="bold">--pgp6</span> except that MDCs are not disabled, and the list of allowable ciphers is expanded to add AES128, AES192, AES256, and TWOFISH. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--pgp8</span> Set up all options to be as PGP 8 compliant as possible. PGP 8 is a lot closer to the OpenPGP standard than previous versions of PGP, so all this does is disable <span Class="bold">--throw-keyids</span> and set <span Class="bold">--escape-from-lines</span>.  All algorithms are allowed except for the SHA224, SHA384, and SHA512 digests.

In general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard. <span Class="bold">--personal-cipher-preferences</span> is the safe way to accomplish the same thing. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--digest-algo \fBname</span> Use <span Class="bold">name</span> as the message digest algorithm. Running the program with the command <span Class="bold">--version</span> yields a list of supported algorithms. In general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard. <span Class="bold">--personal-digest-preferences</span> is the safe way to accomplish the same thing. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--compress-algo \fBname</span> Use compression algorithm <span Class="bold">name</span>. "zlib" is RFC-1950 ZLIB compression. "zip" is RFC-1951 ZIP compression which is used by PGP. "bzip2" is a more modern compression scheme that can compress some things better than zip or zlib, but at the cost of more memory used during compression and decompression. "uncompressed" or "none" disables compression. If this option is not used, the default behavior is to examine the recipient key preferences to see which algorithms the recipient supports. If all else fails, ZIP is used for maximum compatibility. 
<p class="level0">ZLIB may give better compression results than ZIP, as the compression window size is not limited to 8k. BZIP2 may give even better compression results than that, but will use a significantly larger amount of memory while compressing and decompressing. This may be significant in low memory situations. Note, however, that PGP (all versions) only supports ZIP compression. Using any algorithm other than ZIP or "none" will make the message unreadable with PGP. In general, you do not want to use this option as it allows you to violate the OpenPGP standard. <span Class="bold">--personal-compress-preferences</span> is the safe way to accomplish the same thing. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--cert-digest-algo \fBname</span> Use <span Class="bold">name</span> as the message digest algorithm used when signing a key. Running the program with the command <span Class="bold">--version</span> yields a list of supported algorithms. Be aware that if you choose an algorithm that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP implementations do not, then some users will not be able to use the key signatures you make, or quite possibly your entire key. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--disable-cipher-algo \fBname</span> Never allow the use of <span Class="bold">name</span> as cipher algorithm. The given name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm will still get disabled. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--disable-pubkey-algo \fBname</span> Never allow the use of <span Class="bold">name</span> as public key algorithm. The given name will not be checked so that a later loaded algorithm will still get disabled. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--throw-keyids</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-throw-keyids</span> Do not put the recipient key IDs into encrypted messages. This helps to hide the receivers of the message and is a limited countermeasure against traffic analysis. ([Using a little social engineering anyone who is able to decrypt the message can check whether one of the other recipients is the one he suspects.])  On the receiving side, it may slow down the decryption process because all available secret keys must be tried.  <span Class="bold">--no-throw-keyids</span> disables this option. This option is essentially the same as using <span Class="bold">--hidden-recipient</span> for all recipients. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--not-dash-escaped</span> This option changes the behavior of cleartext signatures so that they can be used for patch files. You should not send such an armored file via email because all spaces and line endings are hashed too. You can not use this option for data which has 5 dashes at the beginning of a line, patch files don't have this. A special armor header line tells GnuPG about this cleartext signature option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--escape-from-lines</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-escape-from-lines</span> Because some mailers change lines starting with "From " to "&gt;From " it is good to handle such lines in a special way when creating cleartext signatures to prevent the mail system from breaking the signature. Note that all other PGP versions do it this way too.  Enabled by default. <span Class="bold">--no-escape-from-lines</span> disables this option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--passphrase-repeat \fBn</span> Specify how many times <span Class="bold">gpg</span> will request a new passphrase be repeated.  This is useful for helping memorize a passphrase.  Defaults to 1 repetition. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--passphrase-fd \fBn</span> Read the passphrase from file descriptor <span Class="bold">n</span>. Only the first line will be read from file descriptor <span Class="bold">n</span>. If you use 0 for <span Class="bold">n</span>, the passphrase will be read from STDIN. This can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--passphrase-file \fBfile</span> Read the passphrase from file <span Class="bold">file</span>. Only the first line will be read from file <span Class="bold">file</span>. This can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied. Obviously, a passphrase stored in a file is of questionable security if other users can read this file. Don't use this option if you can avoid it. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--passphrase \fBstring</span> Use <span Class="bold">string</span> as the passphrase. This can only be used if only one passphrase is supplied. Obviously, this is of very questionable security on a multi-user system. Don't use this option if you can avoid it. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--command-fd \fBn</span> This is a replacement for the deprecated shared-memory IPC mode. If this option is enabled, user input on questions is not expected from the TTY but from the given file descriptor. It should be used together with <span Class="bold">--status-fd</span>. See the file doc/DETAILS in the source distribution for details on how to use it. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--command-file \fBfile</span> Same as <span Class="bold">--command-fd</span>, except the commands are read out of file <span Class="bold">file</span> 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--allow-non-selfsigned-uid</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</span> Allow the import and use of keys with user IDs which are not self-signed. This is not recommended, as a non self-signed user ID is trivial to forge. <span Class="bold">--no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid</span> disables. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--allow-freeform-uid</span> Disable all checks on the form of the user ID while generating a new one. This option should only be used in very special environments as it does not ensure the de-facto standard format of user IDs. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--ignore-time-conflict</span> GnuPG normally checks that the timestamps associated with keys and signatures have plausible values. However, sometimes a signature seems to be older than the key due to clock problems. This option makes these checks just a warning. See also <span Class="bold">--ignore-valid-from</span> for timestamp issues on subkeys. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--ignore-valid-from</span> GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in the future. This option allows the use of such keys and thus exhibits the pre-1.0.7 behaviour. You should not use this option unless there is some clock problem. See also <span Class="bold">--ignore-time-conflict</span> for timestamp issues with signatures. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--ignore-crc-error</span> The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC checksum against transmission errors. Occasionally the CRC gets mangled somewhere on the transmission channel but the actual content (which is protected by the OpenPGP protocol anyway) is still okay. This option allows GnuPG to ignore CRC errors. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--ignore-mdc-error</span> This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a warning. This can be useful if a message is partially corrupt, but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out of the corrupt message. However, be aware that a MDC protection failure may also mean that the message was tampered with intentionally by an attacker. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-default-keyring</span> Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings. Note that GnuPG will not operate without any keyrings, so if you use this option and do not provide alternate keyrings via <span Class="bold">--keyring</span> or <span Class="bold">--secret-keyring</span>, then GnuPG will still use the default public or secret keyrings. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--skip-verify</span> Skip the signature verification step. This may be used to make the decryption faster if the signature verification is not needed. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--with-key-data</span> Print key listings delimited by colons (like <span Class="bold">--with-colons</span>) and print the public key data. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--fast-list-mode</span> Changes the output of the list commands to work faster; this is achieved by leaving some parts empty. Some applications don't need the user ID and the trust information given in the listings. By using this options they can get a faster listing. The exact behaviour of this option may change in future versions.  If you are missing some information, don't use this option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-literal</span> This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what it might be useful. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--set-filesize</span> This is not for normal use. Use the source to see for what it might be useful. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--show-session-key</span> Display the session key used for one message. See <span Class="bold">--override-session-key</span> for the counterpart of this option. 
<p class="level0">We think that Key Escrow is a Bad Thing; however the user should have the freedom to decide whether to go to prison or to reveal the content of one specific message without compromising all messages ever encrypted for one secret key. DON'T USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY FORCED TO DO SO. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--override-session-key \fBstring</span> Don't use the public key but the session key <span Class="bold">string</span>. The format of this string is the same as the one printed by <span Class="bold">--show-session-key</span>. This option is normally not used but comes handy in case someone forces you to reveal the content of an encrypted message; using this option you can do this without handing out the secret key. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--ask-sig-expire</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-ask-sig-expire</span> When making a data signature, prompt for an expiration time. If this option is not specified, the expiration time set via <span Class="bold">--default-sig-expire</span> is used. <span Class="bold">--no-ask-sig-expire</span> disables this option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--default-sig-expire</span> The default expiration time to use for signature expiration. Valid values are "0" for no expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for example "2m" for two months, or "5y" for five years), or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to "0". 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--ask-cert-expire</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-ask-cert-expire</span> When making a key signature, prompt for an expiration time. If this option is not specified, the expiration time set via <span Class="bold">--default-cert-expire</span> is used. <span Class="bold">--no-ask-cert-expire</span> disables this option. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--default-cert-expire</span> The default expiration time to use for key signature expiration. Valid values are "0" for no expiration, a number followed by the letter d (for days), w (for weeks), m (for months), or y (for years) (for example "2m" for two months, or "5y" for five years), or an absolute date in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Defaults to "0". 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--allow-secret-key-import</span> This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--allow-multiple-messages</span> 
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-allow-multiple-messages</span> Allow processing of multiple OpenPGP messages contained in a single file or stream.  Some programs that call GPG are not prepared to deal with multiple messages being processed together, so this option defaults to no.  Note that versions of GPG prior to 1.4.7 always allowed multiple messages. 
<p class="level0">Warning: Do not use this option unless you need it as a temporary workaround! 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--enable-special-filenames</span> This options enables a mode in which filenames of the form (oq<span Class="emphasis">-&n</span>(cq, where n is a non-negative decimal number, refer to the file descriptor n and not to a file with that name. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--no-expensive-trust-checks</span> Experimental use only. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--preserve-permissions</span> Don't change the permissions of a secret keyring back to user read/write only. Use this option only if you really know what you are doing. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--default-preference-list \fBstring</span> Set the list of default preferences to <span Class="bold">string</span>. This preference list is used for new keys and becomes the default for "setpref" in the edit menu. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--default-keyserver-url \fBname</span> Set the default keyserver URL to <span Class="bold">name</span>. This keyserver will be used as the keyserver URL when writing a new self-signature on a key, which includes key generation and changing preferences. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--list-config</span> Display various internal configuration parameters of GnuPG. This option is intended for external programs that call GnuPG to perform tasks, and is thus not generally useful. See the file (oq<span Class="emphasis">doc/DETAILS</span>(cq in the source distribution for the details of which configuration items may be listed. <span Class="bold">--list-config</span> is only usable with <span Class="bold">--with-colons</span> set. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--gpgconf-list</span> This command is similar to <span Class="bold">--list-config</span> but in general only internally used by the <span Class="bold">gpgconf</span> tool. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">--gpgconf-test</span> This is more or less dummy action.  However it parses the configuration file and returns with failure if the configuration file would prevent <span Class="bold">gpg</span> from startup.  Thus it may be used to run a syntax check on the configuration file.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">There are different ways to specify a user ID to GnuPG.  Some of them are only valid for <span Class="bold">gpg</span> others are only good for <span Class="bold">gpgsm</span>.  Here is the entire list of ways to specify a key: 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">By key Id.</span> This format is deduced from the length of the string and its content or <span Class="bold">0x</span> prefix. The key Id of an X.509 certificate are the low 64 bits of its SHA-1 fingerprint.  The use of key Ids is just a shortcut, for all automated processing the fingerprint should be used. 
<p class="level0">When using <span Class="bold">gpg</span> an exclamation mark (!) may be appended to force using the specified primary or secondary key and not to try and calculate which primary or secondary key to use. 
<p class="level0">The last four lines of the example give the key ID in their long form as internally used by the OpenPGP protocol. You can see the long key ID using the option <span Class="bold">--with-colons</span>.

<p class="level0">Please note that we have reused the hash mark identifier which was used in old GnuPG versions to indicate the so called local-id.  It is not anymore used and there should be no conflict when used with X.509 stuff. 
<p class="level0">Using the RFC-2253 format of DNs has the drawback that it is not possible to map them back to the original encoding, however we don't have to do this because our key database stores this encoding as meta data.

<p class="level0">There are a few configuration files to control certain aspects of <span Class="bold">gpg</span>'s operation. Unless noted, they are expected in the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]). 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">gpg.conf</span> This is the standard configuration file read by <span Class="bold">gpg</span> on startup.  It may contain any valid long option; the leading two dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.  This default name may be changed on the command line (see: [gpg-option --options]). You should backup this file. 
<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">
<p class="level-1">Note that on larger installations, it is useful to put predefined files into the directory (oq<span Class="emphasis">/etc/skel/.gnupg/</span>(cq so that newly created users start up with a working configuration. 
<p class="level-1">For internal purposes <span Class="bold">gpg</span> creates and maintains a few other files; They all live in in the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).  Only the <span Class="bold">gpg</span> may modify these files. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg</span> The public keyring.  You should backup this file. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg.lock</span> The lock file for the public keyring. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx</span> 
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx.lock</span> A public keyring and its lock file used by GnuPG versions &gt;= 2. It is ignored by GnuPG 1.x 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/secring.gpg</span> The secret keyring.  You should backup this file. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg</span> The trust database.  There is no need to backup this file; it is better to backup the ownertrust values (see: [option --export-ownertrust]). 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg.lock</span> The lock file for the trust database. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/random_seed</span> A file used to preserve the state of the internal random pool. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/secring.gpg.lock</span> The lock file for the secret keyring. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/</span> This is the directory where gpg stores pre-generated revocation certificates.  The file name corresponds to the OpenPGP fingerprint of the respective key.  It is suggested to backup those certificates and if the primary private key is not stored on the disk to move them to an external storage device.  Anyone who can access theses files is able to revoke the corresponding key.  You may want to print them out. You should backup all files in this directory and take care to keep this backup closed away. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">/usr[/local]/share/gnupg/options.skel</span> The skeleton options file. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1"><span Class="bold">/usr[/local]/lib/gnupg/</span> Default location for extensions. 
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-1">
<p class="level-2">Operation is further controlled by a few environment variables: 
<p class="level-2">
<p class="level-2">
<p class="level-2"><span Class="bold">HOME</span> Used to locate the default home directory. 
<p class="level-2">
<p class="level-2"><span Class="bold">GNUPGHOME</span> If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg". 
<p class="level-2">
<p class="level-2"><span Class="bold">GPG_AGENT_INFO</span> Used to locate the gpg-agent. This is only honored when <span Class="bold">--use-agent</span> is set. 
<p class="level-2">The value consists of 3 colon delimited fields: The first is the path to the Unix Domain Socket, the second the PID of the gpg-agent and the protocol version which should be set to 1. When starting the gpg-agent as described in its documentation, this variable is set to the correct value. The option <span Class="bold">--gpg-agent-info</span> can be used to override it. 
<p class="level-2">
<p class="level-2"><span Class="bold">PINENTRY_USER_DATA</span> This value is passed via gpg-agent to pinentry.  It is useful to convey extra information to a custom pinentry. 
<p class="level-2">
<p class="level-2"><span Class="bold">COLUMNS</span> 
<p class="level-2"><span Class="bold">LINES</span> Used to size some displays to the full size of the screen. 
<p class="level-2">
<p class="level-2">
<p class="level-2"><span Class="bold">LANGUAGE</span> Apart from its use by GNU, it is used in the W32 version to override the language selection done through the Registry.  If used and set to a valid and available language name (<span Class="emphasis">langid</span>), the file with the translation is loaded from 
<p class="level-2"><span class="bold"><span Class="emphasis">gpgdir</span>/gnupg.nls/<span Class="emphasis">langid</span>.mo</span>.  Here <span Class="emphasis">gpgdir</span> is the directory out of which the gpg binary has been loaded.  If it can't be loaded the Registry is tried and as last resort the native Windows locale system is used.

<p class="level0">
<p class="level0">On older systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This is necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory pages prevents the operating system from writing memory pages (which may contain passphrases or other sensitive material) to disk. If you get no warning message about insecure memory your operating system supports locking without being root. The program drops root privileges as soon as locked memory is allocated. 
<p class="level0">Note also that some systems (especially laptops) have the ability to ``suspend to disk'' (also known as ``safe sleep'' or ``hibernate''). This writes all memory to disk before going into a low power or even powered off mode.  Unless measures are taken in the operating system to protect the saved memory, passphrases or other sensitive material may be recoverable from it later. 
<p class="level0">Before you report a bug you should first search the mailing list archives for similar problems and second check whether such a bug has already been reported to our bug tracker at <a href="http://bugs.gnupg.org">http://bugs.gnupg.org</a> .
