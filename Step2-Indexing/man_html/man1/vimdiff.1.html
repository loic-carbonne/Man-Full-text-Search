<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Vimdiff</span> starts <span Class="bold">Vim</span> on two (or three or four) files. Each file gets its own window. The differences between the files are highlighted. This is a nice way to inspect changes and to move changes from one version to another version of the same file. 
<p class="level0">See vim(1) for details about Vim itself. 
<p class="level0">When started as <span Class="bold">gvimdiff</span> the GUI will be started, if available. 
<p class="level0">In each window the 'diff' option will be set, which causes the differences to be highlighted. <br>The 'wrap' and 'scrollbind' options are set to make the text look good. <br>The 'foldmethod' option is set to "diff", which puts ranges of lines without changes in a fold.  'foldcolumn' is set to two to make it easy to spot the folds and open or close them. <a name="OPTIONS"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">OPTIONS</h2>
<p class="level0">Vertical splits are used to align the lines, as if the "-O" argument was used. To use horizontal splits instead, use the "-o" argument. 
<p class="level0">For all other arguments see vim(1). <a name="SEE"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">SEE ALSO</h2>
