NAME
       ocamlmktop - Building custom toplevel systems


SYNOPSIS
       ocamlmktop [ -v|-version|-vnum ] [ -cclib libname ] [ -ccopt option ] [
       -custom [ -o exec-file ] [ -I lib-dir ] filename ...


DESCRIPTION
       The ocamlmktop(1) command builds OCaml toplevels that contain user code
       preloaded  at  start-up.  The ocamlmktop(1) command takes as argument a
       set of x.cmo and x.cma files, and links them with the object files that
       implement  the  OCaml toplevel.  If the -custom flag is given, C object
       files and libraries (.o and .a files) can also be given on the  command
       line and are linked in the resulting toplevel.

       -vnum or -version

       -ccopt Pass the given option to the C compiler and linker, when linking
              in  ``custom  runtime''  mode.  See the corresponding option for

       -custom
              Link in ``custom runtime'' mode. See  the  corresponding  option

       -I directory
              Add  the given directory to the list of directories searched for
              compiled interface files (.cmo and .cma).
