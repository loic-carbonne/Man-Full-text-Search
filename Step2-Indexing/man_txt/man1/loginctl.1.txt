NAME
       loginctl - Control the systemd login manager

SYNOPSIS
       loginctl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]

DESCRIPTION
       loginctl may be used to introspect and control the state of the
       systemd(1) login manager systemd-logind.service(8).

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --no-legend
           Do not print the legend, i.e. the column headers and the footer.

       --no-ask-password
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       -p, --property=
           When showing session/user/seat properties, limit display to certain
           properties as specified as argument. If not specified, all set
           properties are shown. The argument should be a property name, such
           as "Sessions". If specified more than once, all properties with the
           specified names are shown.

       -a, --all
           When showing session/user/seat properties, show all properties
           regardless of whether they are set or not.

       -l, --full
           Do not ellipsize process tree entries.

       --kill-who=
           When used with kill-session, choose which processes to kill. Must
           be one of leader, or all to select whether to kill only the leader
           process of the session or all processes of the session. If omitted,
           defaults to all.

       -s, --signal=
           When used with kill-session or kill-user, choose which signal to
           send to selected processes. Must be one of the well known signal
           specifiers, such as SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGSTOP. If omitted,
           defaults to SIGTERM.

       -H, --host=
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username
           and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The hostname may
           optionally be suffixed by a container name, separated by ":", which
           connects directly to a specific container on the specified host.
           This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance.
           Container names may be enumerated with machinectl -H HOST.

       -M, --machine=
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to
           connect to.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       The following commands are understood:

       list-sessions
           List current sessions.

       session-status ID...
           Show terse runtime status information about one or more sessions.
           This function is intended to generate human-readable output. If you
           are looking for computer-parsable output, use show-session instead.

       show-session [ID...]
           Show properties of one or more sessions or the manager itself. If
           no argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown.
           If a session ID is specified, properties of the session are shown.
           By default, empty properties are suppressed. Use --all to show
           those too. To select specific properties to show, use --property=.
           This command is intended to be used whenever computer-parsable
           output is required. Use session-status if you are looking for
           formatted human-readable output.

       activate ID...
           Activate one or more sessions. This brings one or more sessions
           into the foreground, if another session is currently in the
           foreground on the respective seat.

       lock-session ID..., unlock-session ID...
           Activates/deactivates the screen lock on one or more sessions, if
           the session supports it.

       lock-sessions, unlock-sessions
           Activates/deactivates the screen lock on all current sessions
           supporting it.

       terminate-session ID...
           Terminates a session. This kills all processes of the session and
           deallocates all resources attached to the session.

       kill-session ID...
           Send a signal to one or more processes of the session. Use
           --kill-who= to select which process to kill. Use --signal= to
           select the signal to send.

       list-users
           List currently logged in users.

       user-status USER...
           Show terse runtime status information about one or more logged in
           users. This function is intended to generate human-readable output.
           If you are looking for computer-parsable output, use show-user
           instead. Users may be specified by their usernames or numeric user
           IDs.

       show-user [USER...]
           Show properties of one or more users or the manager itself. If no
           argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If
           a user is specified, properties of the user are shown. By default,
           empty properties are suppressed. Use --all to show those too. To
           select specific properties to show, use --property=. This command
           is intended to be used whenever computer-parsable output is
           required. Use user-status if you are looking for formatted
           human-readable output.

       enable-linger USER..., disable-linger USER...
           Enable/disable user lingering for one or more users. If enabled for
           a specific user, a user manager is spawned for the user at boot and
           kept around after logouts. This allows users who are not logged in
           to run long-running services.

       terminate-user USER...
           Terminates all sessions of a user. This kills all processes of all
           sessions of the user and deallocates all runtime resources attached
           to the user.

       kill-user USER...
           Send a signal to all processes of a user. Use --signal= to select
           the signal to send.

       list-seats
           List currently available seats on the local system.

       seat-status NAME...
           Show terse runtime status information about one or more seats. This
           function is intended to generate human-readable output. If you are
           looking for computer-parsable output, use show-seat instead.

       show-seat NAME...
           Show properties of one or more seats or the manager itself. If no
           argument is specified, properties of the manager will be shown. If
           a seat is specified, properties of the seat are shown. By default,
           empty properties are suppressed. Use --all to show those too. To
           select specific properties to show, use --property=. This command
           is intended to be used whenever computer-parsable output is
           required. Use seat-status if you are looking for formatted
           human-readable output.

       attach NAME DEVICE...
           Persistently attach one or more devices to a seat. The devices
           should be specified via device paths in the /sys file system. To
           create a new seat, attach at least one graphics card to a
           previously unused seat name. Seat names may consist only of a-z,
           A-Z, 0-9, "-" and "_" and must be prefixed with "seat". To drop
           assignment of a device to a specific seat, just reassign it to a
           different seat, or use flush-devices.

       flush-devices
           Removes all device assignments previously created with attach.
           After this call, only automatically generated seats will remain,
           and all seat hardware is assigned to them.

       terminate-seat NAME...
           Terminates all sessions on a seat. This kills all processes of all
           sessions on the seat and deallocates all runtime resources attached
           to them.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

ENVIRONMENT
       $SYSTEMD_PAGER
           Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER.
           Setting this to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to
           passing --no-pager.

       $SYSTEMD_LESS
           Override the default options passed to less ("FRSXMK").
