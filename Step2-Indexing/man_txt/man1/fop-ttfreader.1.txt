NAME
       fop-ttfreader --  A tool which reads TTF files and generates XML font
       metrics file for use in FOP.

SYNOPSIS
       fop-ttfreader [options] fontfile.ttf xmlfile.xml

OPTIONS
       -enc ansi
           with this option you can create a WinAnsi encoded font. The default
           is to create a CID keyed font.  If you're not going to use
           characters outside the pdfencoding range (almost the same as
           iso-8889-1) you can add this option.

       -ttcname fontname
           if you're reading data from TrueType Collection (.ttc file) you
           must specify which font from the collection you will read metrics
           from. If you read from a .ttc file without this option, the
           fontnames will be listed for you.

       -fn fontname
           default is to use the fontname in the .ttf file, but you can
           override that name to make sure that the embedded font is used (if
           you're embedding fonts) instead of installed fonts when viewing
           documents with Acrobat Reader.

EXAMPLES
       "fop-ttfreader /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf
       freeserif.xml"
           generates freeserif.xml file containing XML font metrics from
           FreeSerif.ttf

JAVA-WRAPPERS NOTE
       This program is a shell script wrapper based on java-wrappers(7).  You
       therefore benefit from several features; please see the java-
       wrappers(7) manual page for more information about them.
