NAME
       outocp - debug an OCP file

SYNOPSIS
       outocp OCPFILE[.ocp]

DESCRIPTION
       outocp  is  used for debugging Omega Compiled Translation Process (OCP)
       files.  It generates some statistics about the OCP file, and then  runs
       through the states that the file defines.

       Omega  Translation  Processes are rules used to translate one character
       set to another and to choose between characters with one or  more  con-
       text-sensitive variants.  OTPs could also be used to change the case or
       hyphenation of text.

BUGS
       None known, but report any found to <omega@ens.fr> (mailing list).
