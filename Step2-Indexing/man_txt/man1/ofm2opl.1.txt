NAME
       ofm2opl  -  convert  Omega  and  TeX font-metric files to property-list
       files

SYNOPSIS
       ofm2opl [OPTIONS] OFMNAME[.ofm] [OPLFILE[.opl]]

DESCRIPTION
       ofm2opl translates a binary Omega Font Metrics file,  OFMNAME,  into  a
       human-readable property-list form.  The program writes to standard out-
       put (by default) or to a file specified as OPLFILE.

       The program also works with TeX TFM  files,  producing  TeX  PL  files.
       (ofm2opl is based on the WEB source code for tftopl(1).)

OPTIONS
       -charcode-format=TYPE
              output  character  codes  according to TYPE, which can be either
              `hex' or `ascii'.  Default is `hex'.  ascii specifes  all  ASCII
              letters and digits; hex gets you everything else.

       -help  display a brief summary of syntax and options

       -verbose
              display progress reports

       -version
              output version information and exit

FILES
       OFMNAME
              an Omega Font Metric file

       OPLFILE

AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              The first TFtoPL program was designed by Leo Guibas in the  sum-
              mer of 1978.  Contributions by Frank Liang, Doug Wyatt, and Lyle
              Ramshaw also had a significant effect on the  evolution  of  the
              present code.

              Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added by D.E.
              Knuth in 1989.

              Extensions to handle extended font metric files  (``OFM'')  were
              added  by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996, result-
              ing in the new program OFM2OPL.
