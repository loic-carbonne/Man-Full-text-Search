NAME
       mate-gsettings-toggle - wrapper for MATE gsettings keys

SYNOPSIS
       mate-gsettings-toggle KEY

DESCRIPTION
       mate-gsettings-toggle  is  a  small wrapper script around the gsettings
       command.

       Gsettings does not have toggle option which  mateconftool-2  and  gcon-
       ftool-2 did.  mate-gsettings-toggle is a small wrapper around the gset-
       tings command which adds toggle functionality.

OPTIONS
       mate-gsettings-toggle takes a limited set of gsettings keys that are in
       the  org.mate.applications-at  SCHEMA.  The keys can be one of: screen-
       keyboard-enabled screen-magnifier-enabled screen-reader-enabled.
