gmrun(1)                    General Commands Manual                   gmrun(1)



NAME
       gmrun - Featureful CLI-like GTK+ application launcher

SYNOPSIS
       gmrun [TEXT]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the gmrun command.  This manual page
       was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the  original
       program does not have a manual page.

       gmrun  is  a  program that allows a user to use a CLI-like interface to
       launch applications from within the X11 windowing  environment.  It  is
       based on the GTK+ toolkit.

OPTIONS
       If  gmrun  is  invoked  with a command-line parameter, that will be the
       initial content of the dialog box.

       gmrun can be customized using a configuration file,  ~/.gmrunrc  .  The
       system-wide configuration file is /etc/gmrunrc .

       The  format of the configuration file is simple; "variable = value". To
       refer to a variable as opposed to setting it, enclose the  variable  in
       ${}.

       Example:
              variable1 = foobar
              newvariable = ${variable1} foobaz

       Were  this  placed  within  the  configuration file, the gmrun variable
       "newvariable" would contain the text "foobar  foobaz".  Some  variables
       that are understood by gmrun, by default. These are:

       Terminal
              The  command  to  run when Ctrl+Enter is pressed with no command
              entered; used to start a new terminal.

       TermExec
              The command to run when Ctrl+Enter is  pressed  with  a  command
              entered.  The entered command is supplied as an argument to Ter-
              mExec.

       Width  Initial width of gmrun window.

       Top, Left
              Initial placement of gmrun window - specify both  Top  and  Left
              variables  such  that  the  gmrun  window  is  placed  at  pixel
              (Top,Left) of your desktop.

       History
              Number of entered commands which should be kept in gmrun's  his-
              tory(~/.gmrun_history).  Using the Up and Down arrow keys within
              the gmrun window will cycle through the history. You can  search
              backwards  through  the  history  with  Ctrl+R  or  by writing !
              (exclamation mark), and forward with Ctrl+S. To cancel a search,
              hit  Ctrl+G  or the ESC key. Otherwise, after you have found the
              history item you wish to run, hit Enter.

       ShowLast
              Whether to show the last command as initial text,  or  an  empty
              textarea (1 or 0).

       Selected
              Whether the initial text should be selected or not (1 or 0).

URL HANDLING
       As  opposed to entering a command, gmrun supports the entering of URLs.
       The included configuration file(/etc/gmrunrc) gives some  examples.  To
       set  up  your  own url, create a variable in /etc/gmrunrc or ~/.gmrunrc
       with the format of "URL_protocol". For instance, URL_http. Here  is  an
       example:

       URL_http = /usr/bin/mozilla %u
              Using   this,   entering   "http://www.slashdot.org"   will  run
              '/usr/bin/mozilla http://slashdot.org'.

       gmrun may also strip the protocol and colon away from the  entered  URL
       before passing it to the defined program. For example:

       URL_mailto = mutt %s
              Using  this,  entering "mailto:david@eelf.ddts.net" will run the
              command 'mutt david@eelf.ddts.net'

       The included configuration files has a few examples which you can  work
       with.  You  should also note that the protocol part of URL_protocol can
       be *anything*. You can set up "URL_foobarbazcustom", and so long as you
       enter  in  "foobarbazcustom:<whatever>", it will use the given program.
       Have fun :)
