GIT-CREDENTIAL-CAC(1)             Git Manual             GIT-CREDENTIAL-CAC(1)



NAME
       git-credential-cache--daemon - Temporarily store user credentials in
       memory

SYNOPSIS
       git credential-cache--daemon <socket>


DESCRIPTION
           Note
           You probably don't want to invoke this command yourself; it is
           started automatically when you use git-credential-cache(1).

       This command listens on the Unix domain socket specified by <socket>
       for git-credential-cache clients. Clients may store and retrieve
       credentials. Each credential is held for a timeout specified by the
       client; once no credentials are held, the daemon exits.
