NAME
       coq-tex - Process Coq phrases embedded in LaTeX files


SYNOPSIS
       coq-tex  [ -o output-file ] [ -n line-width ] [ -image coq-image ] [ -w
       ] [ -v ] [ -sl ] [ -hrule ] [ -small ] input-file ...



DESCRIPTION
       The coq-tex filter extracts Coq phrases embedded in LaTeX files, evalu-
       ates them, and insert the outcome of the evaluation after each phrase.

       Three  LaTeX environments are provided to include Coq code in the input
       files:

       coq_example
              The phrases between  \begin{coq_example}  and  \end{coq_example}
              are  evaluated  and  copied into the output file. Each phrase is
              followed by the response of the toplevel loop.

       coq_example*
              The phrases between \begin{coq_example*} and  \end{coq_example*}
              are  evaluated and copied into the output file. The responses of
              the toplevel loop are discarded.

       coq_eval
              The phrases  between  \begin{coq_eval}  and  \end{coq_eval}  are
              silently  evaluated.  They  are not copied into the output file,
              and the responses of the toplevel loop are discarded.

       The resulting LaTeX code is stored in the file file.v.tex if the  input
       file  has a name of the form file.tex, otherwise the name of the output
       file is the name of the input file with `.v.tex' appended.

       The files produced by coq-tex can be directly processed by LaTeX.  Both
       the Coq phrases and the toplevel output are typeset in typewriter font.


OPTIONS
       -o output-file
              Specify  the  name  of  a  file  where the LaTeX output is to be
              stored. A dash `-' causes the LaTeX  output  to  be  printed  on
              standard output.

       -n line-width
              Set  the line width. The default is 72 characters. The responses
              of the toplevel loop are folded if they are longer than the line
              width. No folding is performed on the Coq input text.

       -image coq-image
              Cause  the  file  coq-image  to  be executed to evaluate the Coq
              phrases. By default, this is the command coqtop without specify-
              ing any path which is used to evaluate the Coq phrases.

       -w     Cause lines to be folded on a space character whenever possible,
              avoiding word cuts in the output. By default, folding occurs  at
              the line width, regardless of word cuts.

       -v     Verbose  mode.  Prints  the  Coq answers on the standard output.
              Useful to detect errors in Coq phrases.

       -sl    Slanted mode. The Coq answers are written in a slanted font.

       -hrule Horizontal lines mode. The Coq parts  are  written  between  two
              horizontal lines.

       -small Small font mode. The Coq parts are written in a smaller font.



CAVEATS
       The  \begin...  and  \end...  phrases must sit on a line by themselves,
       with no characters before the backslash or  after  the  closing  brace.
       Each  Coq phrase must be terminated by `.' at the end of a line.  Blank
       space is accepted between `.' and the newline, but any other  character
       will  cause  coq-tex  to  ignore the end of the phrase, resulting in an
       incorrect shuffling of the responses into the phrases.  (The  responses
       ``lag behind''.)
