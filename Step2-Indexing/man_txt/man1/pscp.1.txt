DESCRIPTION

       The command-line options supported by pscp are:

       -V     Show version information and exit.

       -pgpfp Display the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys and  exit,
              to aid in verifying new files released by the PuTTY team.

       -ls    Remote directory listing.

       -p     Preserve file attributes.

       -q     Quiet, don't show statistics.

       -r     Copy directories recursively.
