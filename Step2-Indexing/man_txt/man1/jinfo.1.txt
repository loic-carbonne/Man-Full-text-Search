Name
       jinfo - Configuration Info

SYNOPSIS
       jinfo [ option ] pid
       jinfo [ option ] executable core
       jinfo [ option ] [server-id@]remote-hostname-or-IP


PARAMETERS
          option
             Options  are  mutually  exclusive. Option, if used, should follow
             immediately after the command name.


          pid
             process id for which the configuration info is to be printed. The
             process  must  be a Java process. To get a list of Java processes
             running on a machine, jps(1) may be used.


          executable
             Java executable from which the core dump was produced.


          core
             core file for which the configuration info is to be printed.


          remote-hostname-or-IP
             remote debug server's (see jsadebugd(1)) hostname or IP address.


          server-id
             optional unique id, if multiple debug servers are running on  the
             same remote host.


DESCRIPTION
       jinfo prints Java configuration information for a given Java process or
       core file or a remote debug server. Configuration information  includes
       Java  System properties and Java virtual machine command line flags. If
       the given process is running on a 64-bit VM, you may  need  to  specify
       the -J-d64 option, e.g.:
       jinfo -J-d64 -sysprops pid

       NOTE  -  This utility is unsupported and may or may not be available in
       future versions of the JDK. In Windows Systems where dbgeng.dll is  not
       present,  'Debugging  Tools  For  Windows' need to be installed to have
       these tools working. Also, PATH environment variable should contain the
       location  of  jvm.dll  used  by the target process or the location from
       which the Crash Dump file was produced.

       For example, set PATH=<jdk>\jre\bin\client;%PATH%

OPTIONS
          <no option>
             prints both command line flags as well as System properties name,
             value pairs.

          -flag name
             prints the name and value of the given command line flag.

          -flag [+|-]name
             enables or disables the given boolean command line flag.

          -flag name=value
             sets the given command line flag to the specified value.

          -flags
             prints command line flags passed to the JVM. pairs.

          -sysprops
             prints Java System properties as name, value pairs.
