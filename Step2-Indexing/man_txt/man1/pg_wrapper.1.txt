PG_WRAPPER(1)          Debian PostgreSQL infrastructure          PG_WRAPPER(1)



NAME
       pg_wrapper - wrapper for PostgreSQL client commands

SYNOPSIS
       client-program [--cluster version/cluster] [...]

       (client-program: psql, createdb, dropuser, and all other client
       programs installed in /usr/lib/postgresql/version/bin).

DESCRIPTION
       This program is run only as a link to names which correspond to
       PostgreSQL programs in /usr/lib/postgresql/version/bin. It determines
       the configured cluster and database for the user and calls the
       appropriate version of the desired program to connect to that cluster
       and database, supplying any specified options to that command.

       The target cluster is selected by the following means, in descending
       order of precedence:

       1.  explicit specification with the --host option

       2.  explicit specification with the --cluster option

       3.  if the PGHOST environment variable is set, no further cluster
           selection is performed. The default PostgreSQL version and port
           number (from the command line, the environment variable PGPORT, or
           default 5432) will be used.

       4.  explicit specification with the PGCLUSTER environment variable

       5.  matching entry in ~/.postgresqlrc (see postgresqlrc(5)), if that
           file exists

       6.  matching entry in /etc/postgresql-common/user_clusters (see
           user_clusters(5)), if that file exists

       7.  If only one local cluster exists, that one will be selected.

       8.  If several local clusters exist, the one listening on the default
           port 5432 will be selected.

       If none of these rules match, pg_wrapper aborts with an error.

       For psql, pg_archivecleanup, and pg_isready, pg_wrapper will always use
       the binary from the newest PostgreSQL version installed, as these are
       downwards compatible.

OPTIONS
       --cluster version/cluster
           cluster is either the name of a local cluster, or takes the form
           host:port for a remote cluster. If port is left empty (i. e. you
           just specify host:), it defaults to 5432.

ENVIRONMENT
       PGCLUSTER
           If $PGCLUSTER is set, its value (of the form version/cluster)
           specifies the desired cluster, similar to the --cluster option.
           However, if --cluster is specified, it overrides the value of
           $PGCLUSTER.

       PG_CLUSTER_CONF_ROOT
           This specifies an alternative base directory for cluster
           configurations. This is usually /etc/postgresql/, but for
           testing/development purposes you can change this to point to e. g.
           your home directory, so that you can use the postgresql-common
           tools without root privileges.

       PGSYSCONFDIR
           This is the location of PostgreSQL's and postgresql-common's global
           configuration (e. g. pg_service.conf, user_clusters(5)). The
           default is /etc/postgresql-common/.

FILES
       /etc/postgresql-common/user_clusters
           stores the default cluster and database for users and groups as set
           by the administrators.

       $HOME/.postgresqlrc
           stores defaults set by the user himself.
