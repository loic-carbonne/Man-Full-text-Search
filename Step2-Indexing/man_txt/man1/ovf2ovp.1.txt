NAME
       ovf2ovp  -  convert  a virtual font file and its associated font metric
       file into property-list format

SYNOPSIS
       ovf2ovp [OPTIONS] OVFNAME[.ovf] [OFMNAME[.ofm] [OVPFILE[.ovp]]]

DESCRIPTION
       ovf2ovp translates a virtual font (OVF) file, OVFNAME, and its  compan-
       ion  font  metric  (OFM) file, OFMNAME, into a human-readable property-
       list format.  The program writes to standard output (by default) or  to
       a file specified as OVPNAME.

       The  program  also  works  with  TeX VF and TFM files, producing TeX VP
       files.  (ovf2ovp is based on the WEB source code for vftovp(1).)

OPTIONS
       -charcode-format=TYPE
              output character codes according to TYPE, which  can  be  either
              `hex'  or  `ascii'.  Default is `hex'.  ascii specifes all ASCII
              letters and digits; hex gets you everything else.

       -help  display a brief summary of syntax and options

       -verbose
              display progress reports

       -version
              output version information and exit

AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              VFtoVP is an extended version of the program  TFtoPL,  which  is
              part  of  the standard tex()ware library.  The idea of a virtual
              font was inspired by the work of David R. Fuchs who  designed  a
              similar  set  of  conventions  in 1984 while developing a device
              driver for ArborText, Inc.  He wrote a somewhat similar  program
              called AMFtoXPL.
