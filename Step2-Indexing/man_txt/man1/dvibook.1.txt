NAME
       dvibook - rearrange pages in DVI file into signatures

SYNOPSIS
       dvibook [ -q ] [ -s<num> ] [ -i infile ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile [ out-
       file ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Dvibook rearranges pages from a DVI file produced by TeX into  ``signa-
       tures''  for printing books or booklets, creating a new DVI file usable
       by any of the TeX conversion programs.

       The -s option selects the size of signature which  will  be  used.  The
       signature  size  is  the number of sides which will be folded and bound
       together; the number given should be a multiple of four. The default is
       to  use  one  signature  for  the whole file. Extra blank sides will be
       added if the file does not contain a multiple of four pages.

       Dvibook normally prints the page numbers of the pages  rearranged;  the
       -q option suppresses this.

BUGS
       Dvibook does not adjust the parameters in the postamble; however, since
       these values are normally used only to size certain structures  in  the
       output  conversion  programs,  and  the  parameters  never  need  to be
       adjusted upward, this has not proven to be a problem.
