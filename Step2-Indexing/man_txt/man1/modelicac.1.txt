modelicac(1)                General Commands Manual               modelicac(1)



NAME
       modelicac  -  modelicac is a compiler for a subset of the Modelica lan-
       guage including parts of the 'equation' subset that can  express  rela-
       tions between Real variable.

SYNOPSIS
       modelicac  [-c]  [-o  <outputfile>] <inputfile> [ -L directory | -hpath
       directory | -keep-all-variables | -jac | -no-parameter-removal  |  -no-
       simplifs  | -trace filename | -xml ] This manual page documents briefly
       the modelicac commands.  Note that modelicac is only available  on  the
       platform  which are supported by ocamlopt (ie amd64 hurd-i386 i386 pow-
       erpc sparc)

OPTIONS
       A complete list of options is included below.

       -c     Compile only, do not instantiate. Modelicac produces  a  "*.moc"
              file when invoked with that option.

       -o outputfile
              Set  output  file  name  to <outputfile> (this option also works
              with -c option but is somewhat useless because of the class name
              restrictions given above).

       -L directory
              Add  <directory>  to the list of directories to be searched when
              producing a C file (no effect when used with -c).

       -hpath directory
              Specify a path to be added to #include directives in the  gener-
              ated C code.

       -keep-all-variables
               Do not remove any variable from the initial system.

       -jac   Generate analytic jacobian matrix code.

       -no-parameter-removal
              Do not remove any parameter

       -no-simplifs
              Same as -keep-all-variables -no-parameter-removal

       -trace filename
              Generate  tracing  information  for external function calls into
              <filename>

       -xml   Generate an XML version of the model instead of target code
