NAME
       hp2ps - convert a heap profile to a POSTSCRIPT graph

SYNOPSIS
       hp2ps [flags] [file][.hp]

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  hp2ps converts a heap profile stored in file into a POST-
       SCRIPT graph, sending the result to file.ps.  By convention,  files  to
       be  processed by hp2ps have a .hp extension. However, for compatibility
       with older versions of hp2ps, this extension can be omitted. If file is
       omitted entirely, then the program behaves as a filter.

OPTIONS
       The flags are:

       -d     In  order  to  make graphs more readable, hp2ps sorts the shaded
              bands for each identifier. The default sort ordering is for  the
              bands  with the largest area to be stacked on top of the smaller
              ones.  The -d option causes  rougher  bands  (those  reprsenting
              series  of  values  with  the largest standard deviations) to be
              stacked on top of smoother ones.

       -b     Normally, hp2ps puts the title of the graph in a  small  box  at
              the  top  of the page. However, if the JOB string is too long to
              fit in a small box (more than 35 characters),  then  hp2ps  will
              choose  to  use a big box instead. The -b option forces hp2ps to
              use a big box.

       -e float[in|mm|pt]
              Generate encapsulated POSTSCRIPT suitable for inclusion in LaTeX
              documents.   Usually, the POSTSCRIPT graph is drawn in landscape
              mode in an area 9 inches  wide  by  6  inches  high,  and  hp2ps
              arranges  for  this area to be approximately centered on a sheet
              of a4 paper. This format is convenient of studying the graph  in
              detail,  but  it is unsuitable for inclusion in LaTeX documents.
              The -e option causes the graph to be  drawn  in  portrait  mode,
              with float specifying the width in inches, millimetres or points
              (the default).  The resulting POSTSCRIPT file  conforms  to  the
              Encapsulated  Post  Script  (EPS)  convention,  and  it  can  be
              included in a LaTeX document using  Rokicki's  dvi-to-POSTSCRIPT
              converter dvips.  hp2ps requires the width to exceed 2 inches.

       -g     Create output suitable for the gs POSTSCRIPT previewer (or simi-
              lar). In this case the graph is printed in portrait mode without
              scaling. The output is unsuitable for a laser printer.

       -p     Use  previous  parameters.  By  default, the POSTSCRIPT graph is
              automatically scaled both horizontally and vertically so that it
              fills  the page.  However, when preparing a seires of graphs for
              use in a presentation, it is often useful to draw  a  new  graph
              using  the  same  scale, shading and ordering as a previous one.
              The -p flag causes the graph to be drawn  using  the  parameters
              determined by a previous run of hp2ps on file.

       -s     Use a small box for the title.

       -y     Draw the graph in the traditional York style, ignoring marks.

INPUT FORMAT
       The format of a heap profile is best described by example:

              JOB "a.out -p"
              DATE "Fri Apr 17 11:43:45 1992"
              SAMPLE_UNIT "seconds"
              VALUE_UNIT "bytes"
              BEGIN_SAMPLE 0.00
                SYSTEM 24
              END_SAMPLE 0.00
              BEGIN_SAMPLE 1.00
                elim 180
                insert 24
                intersect 12
                disin 60
                main 12
                reduce 20
                SYSTEM 12
              END_SAMPLE 1.00
              MARK 1.50
              MARK 1.75
              MARK 1.80
              BEGIN_SAMPLE 2.00
                elim 192
                insert 24
                intersect 12
                disin 84
                main 12
                SYSTEM 24
              END_SAMPLE 2.00
              BEGIN_SAMPLE 2.82
              END_SAMPLE 2.82
