Name

          The rmiregistry command starts a remote object registry on the spec-
          ified port on the current host.


SYNOPSIS
       rmiregistry [port]


DESCRIPTION
       The rmiregistry command creates and starts a remote object registry  on
       the  specified  port  on the current host. If port is omitted, the reg-
       istry is started on port 1099. The rmiregistry command produces no out-
       put and is typically run in the background. For example:

       rmiregistry &

       A  remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service that is used by
       RMI servers on the same host to bind remote objects to  names.  Clients
       on  local  and  remote  hosts  can then look up remote objects and make
       remote method invocations.

       The registry is typically used to locate the  first  remote  object  on
       which  an application needs to invoke methods. That object in turn will
       provide application-specific support for finding other objects.

       The methods of the java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class are  used  to
       get a registry operating on the local host or local host and port.

       The  URL-based  methods  of the java.rmi.Naming class operate on a reg-
       istry and can be used to look up a remote object on any  host,  and  on
       the  local host: bind a simple (string) name to a remote object, rebind
       a new name to a remote object (overriding the old  binding),  unbind  a
       remote object, and list the URLs bound in the registry.

OPTIONS
          -J Used  in  conjunction  with any java option, it passes the option
             following the -J (no spaces between the -J and the option) on  to
             the java interpreter.
