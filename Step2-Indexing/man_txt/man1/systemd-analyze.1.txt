DESCRIPTION
       systemd-analyze may be used to determine system boot-up performance
       statistics and retrieve other state and tracing information from the
       system and service manager.

       systemd-analyze time prints the time spent in the kernel before
       userspace has been reached, the time spent in the initial RAM disk
       (initrd) before normal system userspace has been reached, and the time
       normal system userspace took to initialize. Note that these
       measurements simply measure the time passed up to the point where all
       system services have been spawned, but not necessarily until they fully
       finished initialization or the disk is idle.

       systemd-analyze blame prints a list of all running units, ordered by
       the time they took to initialize. This information may be used to
       optimize boot-up times. Note that the output might be misleading as the
       initialization of one service might be slow simply because it waits for
       the initialization of another service to complete.

       systemd-analyze critical-chain [UNIT...]  prints a tree of the
       time-critical chain of units (for each of the specified UNITs or for
       the default target otherwise). The time after the unit is active or
       started is printed after the "@" character. The time the unit takes to
       start is printed after the "+" character. Note that the output might be
       misleading as the initialization of one service might depend on socket
       activation and because of the parallel execution of units.

       systemd-analyze plot prints an SVG graphic detailing which system
       services have been started at what time, highlighting the time they
       spent on initialization.

       systemd-analyze dot generates textual dependency graph description in
       dot format for further processing with the GraphViz dot(1) tool. Use a
       command line like systemd-analyze dot | dot -Tsvg > systemd.svg to
       generate a graphical dependency tree. Unless --order or --require is
       passed, the generated graph will show both ordering and requirement
       dependencies. Optional pattern globbing style specifications (e.g.
       *.target) may be given at the end. A unit dependency is included in the
       graph if any of these patterns match either the origin or destination
       node.

       systemd-analyze dump outputs a (usually very long) human-readable
       serialization of the complete server state. Its format is subject to
       change without notice and should not be parsed by applications.

       systemd-analyze set-log-level LEVEL changes the current log level of
       the systemd daemon to LEVEL (accepts the same values as --log-level=
       described in systemd(1)).

       If no command is passed, systemd-analyze time is implied.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --user
           Shows performance data of user sessions instead of the system
           manager.

       --system
           Shows performance data of the system manager. This is the implied
           default.

       --order, --require
           When used in conjunction with the dot command (see above), selects
           which dependencies are shown in the dependency graph. If --order is
           passed, only dependencies of type After= or Before= are shown. If
           --require is passed, only dependencies of type Requires=,
           RequiresOverridable=, Requisite=, RequisiteOverridable=, Wants= and
           Conflicts= are shown. If neither is passed, this shows dependencies
           of all these types.

       --from-pattern=, --to-pattern=
           When used in conjunction with the dot command (see above), this
           selects which relationships are shown in the dependency graph. They
           both require glob(7) patterns as arguments, which are matched
           against left-hand and right-hand, respectively, nodes of a
           relationship. Each of these can be used more than once, which means
           a unit name must match one of the given values.

       --fuzz=timespan
           When used in conjunction with the critical-chain command (see
           above), also show units, which finished timespan earlier, than the
           latest unit in the same level. The unit of timespan is seconds
           unless specified with a different unit, e.g. "50ms".

       -H, --host=
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username
           and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The hostname may
           optionally be suffixed by a container name, separated by ":", which
           connects directly to a specific container on the specified host.
           This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance.
           Container names may be enumerated with machinectl -H HOST.

       -M, --machine=
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to
           connect to.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

EXAMPLES
       This plots all dependencies of any unit whose name starts with
       "avahi-daemon.":

           $ systemd-analyze dot 'avahi-daemon.*' | dot -Tsvg > avahi.svg
           $ eog avahi.svg

       This plots the dependencies between all known target units:

           systemd-analyze dot --to-pattern='*.target' --from-pattern='*.target' | dot -Tsvg > targets.svg
           $ eog targets.svg

ENVIRONMENT
       $SYSTEMD_PAGER
           Pager to use when --no-pager is not given; overrides $PAGER.
           Setting this to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to
           passing --no-pager.

       $SYSTEMD_LESS
           Override the default options passed to less ("FRSXMK").
