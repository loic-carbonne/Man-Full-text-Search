NAME
       sha256sum - compute and check SHA256 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       sha256sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print  or check SHA256 (256-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when FILE
       is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read SHA256 sums from the FILEs and check them

       --tag  create a BSD-style checksum

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

   The following four options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --quiet
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       --strict
              exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2.  When  checking,  the
       input  should  be a former output of this program.  The default mode is
       to print a line with checksum, a character indicating input  mode  ('*'
       for binary, space for text), and name for each FILE.
