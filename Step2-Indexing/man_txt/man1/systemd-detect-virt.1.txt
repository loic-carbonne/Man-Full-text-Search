NAME
       systemd-detect-virt - Detect execution in a virtualized environment

SYNOPSIS
       systemd-detect-virt [OPTIONS...]

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-detect-virt detects execution in a virtualized environment. It
       identifies the virtualization technology and can distinguish full VM
       virtualization from container virtualization.

       When executed without --quiet will print a short identifier for the
       detected virtualization technology. The following technologies are
       currently identified: qemu, kvm, vmware, microsoft, oracle, xen, bochs,
       chroot, uml, openvz, lxc, lxc-libvirt, systemd-nspawn.

       If multiple virtualization solutions are used, only the "innermost" is
       detected and identified. That means if both VM virtualization and
       container virtualization are used in conjunction, only the latter will
       be identified (unless --vm is passed).

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -c, --container
           Only detects container virtualization (i.e. shared kernel
           virtualization).

       -v, --vm
           Only detects VM virtualization (i.e. full hardware virtualization).

       -q, --quiet
           Suppress output of the virtualization technology identifier.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       If a virtualization technology is detected, 0 is returned, a non-zero
       code otherwise.
