NAME
       Baobab - A graphical tool to analyse disk usage

SYNOPSIS
       baobab  [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       baobab is able to scan either specific folders or the whole filesystem
       (local and remote), in order to give the user a graphical tree repre-
       sentation including each directory size or percentage in the branch.
       It also auto-detects in real-time any change made to your home direc-
       tory as far as any mounted/unmounted device. A graphical treemap window
       is also provided for any selected folder.

       A detailed documentation on the program could be read at:
