DESCRIPTION
       Display FILE, or standard input, on X screen.

       -p, --pos=POS
              This  option tells osd_cat where to display the text. POS can be
              top, middle, or bottom. The default is top.

       -o, --offset=OFFSET
              This option specifies the offset  from  the  top  or  bottom  of
              screen the text is displayed. The default is 0.

       -A, --align=ALIGN
              This  option  tells osd_cat where to display the text. ALIGN can
              be left, right or center. The default is left.

       -i, --indent=OFFSET
              This option specifies the INDENT from the  left  of  screen  the
              text is displayed. The default is 0.

       -f, --font=FONT
              This  option  specifies  the  FONT to be used for displaying the
              text. The default is fixed.

       -c, --color=COLOR
              This option specifies the COLOR to be used  for  displaying  the
              text. The default is red.

       -d, --delay=TIME
              This  option  specifies  the  number of seconds the text is dis-
              played. The default is 5 seconds.

       -l, --lines=LINES
              This option specifies the number of LINES to scroll the  display
              over. The default is 5.

       -s, --shadow=OFFSET
              This option specifies the OFFSET of the text shadow. The default
              is 0, which means no text shadow is created.

       -S, --shadowcolour=COLOUR
              This option specifies  the  COLOUR  of  the  text  shadow.   The
              default is black.

       -O, --outline=WIDTH
              This  option  specifies  the  WIDTH  of  the  text outline.  The
              default is 0, which is no outline.

       -u, --outlinecolour=COLOUR
              This option specifies the  COLOUR  of  the  text  outline.   The
              default is black.

       -a, --age[=SCROLL_AGE]
              This option affects screen redrawing. If SCROLL_AGE seconds pass
              before a new line is ready (for example, you're reading  from  a
              pipe),  all  lines are cleared at once instead of being scrolled
              off as new lines replace old lines. The default is 0.
              When no SCROLL_AGE is explicitly given, the current  value  from
              DELAY is used.

       -w, --wait
              This  option  also  affects screen redrawing. When there is data
              ready to be put on screen, this option  will  cause  osd_cat  to
              wait until the display is clear. An alternative to scrolling.

       -b, --barmode=TYPE
              Lets  you  display  a  percentage  or slider bar instead of just
              text.  TYPE may be percentage or slider.  In this mode  no  text
              is read from any file, but the following options can be used:

       -P, --percentage=PERCENTAGE
              This  option  specified  the position of the percentage / slider
              bar.  PERCENTAGE may be in the range from 0 to 100, the  default
              is 50.

       -T, --text=TEXT
              This  option  specifies  an  optional  TEXT which gets displayed
              above the percentage bar.  The default is  empty,  so  no  addi-
              tional text is displayed.

       -h, --help
              display help (which is often more up to date) and exit

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
