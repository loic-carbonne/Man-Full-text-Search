NAME
       fai-debconf - set debconf values using classes

SYNOPSIS
       fai-debconf [OPTION] DIRECTORY

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  is only called internally by FAI and not directly by the
       user.

       fai-debconf reads files in DIRECTORY which are also a defined class. If
       the  name  of the class is a directory, all files in this directory are
       read. The files must have the format of debconf-get-selections(1).  All
       this  input  is used to call debconf-set-selections(1). This is done in
       the chroot environment, if the variable $ROOTCMD is set. After  setting
       the  debconf  values,  dpkg-reconfigure(8)  is called for every package
       which is installed and for which some debconf data was set.


OPTIONS
       -h     Show help, version and summary of options.

       -s     Skip reconfiguration of packages. Only  set  values  in  debconf
              database.

       -v     Create verbose output.

       -d     Add additional debuging output. Implies the -v option.

       -f     Run  dpkg-reconfigure  for  all packages FAI has information on,
              not only for those whose database entries were modified.
