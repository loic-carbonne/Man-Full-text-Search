SYNOPSIS
       lxsession

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the lxsession command.

       lxsession is a program that provides a X11 session manager. It is the
       default X11 session manager of LXDE.

       A session manager is used to automatically start a set of applications
       and set up a working desktop environment. Moreover, when the user
       logout, it remembers the applications in use, and restart them the next
       time you login.
