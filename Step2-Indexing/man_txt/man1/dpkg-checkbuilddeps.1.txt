NAME
       dpkg-checkbuilddeps - check build dependencies and conflicts

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-checkbuilddeps [option...]  [control-file]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  checks  the installed packages in the system against the
       build dependencies and build conflicts listed in the control  file.  If
       any are not met, it displays them and exits with a nonzero return code.

       By  default,  debian/control is read, but an alternate control filename
       may be specified on the command line.

OPTIONS
       --admindir=dir
              Change the location of the dpkg database. The  default  location
              is /var/lib/dpkg.

       -A     Ignore  Build-Depends-Arch  and  Build-Conflicts-Arch lines. Use
              when only arch-indep packages will be built, or combine with  -B
              when only a source package is to be built.

       -B     Ignore  Build-Depends-Indep and Build-Conflicts-Indep lines. Use
              when only arch-dep packages will be built, or  combine  with  -A
              when only a source package is to be built.

       -d build-depends-string

       -c build-conflicts-string
              Use the given build dependencies/conflicts instead of those con-
              tained in the debian/control file.

       -a arch
              Check build dependencies/conflicts  assuming  that  the  package
              described  in the control file is to be built for the given host
              architecture instead of the architecture of the current system.

       -P profile[,...]
              Check build dependencies/conflicts  assuming  that  the  package
              described in the control file is to be built for the given build
              profile(s). The argument is a comma-separated  list  of  profile
              names.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DEB_BUILD_PROFILES
              If  set,  it will be used as the active build profile(s) for the
              package being built. It is a space  separated  list  of  profile
              names. Overridden by the -P option.
