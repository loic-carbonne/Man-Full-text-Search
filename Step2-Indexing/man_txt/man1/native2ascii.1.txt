Name
       native2ascii - Native-to-ASCII Converter

       Converts  a file with characters in any supported character encoding to
       one with ASCII and/or Unicode escapes, or visa versa.

SYNOPSIS
       native2ascii [options] [inputfile [outputfile]]


DESCRIPTION
       native2ascii converts files that are encoded to any character  encoding
       that  is  supported by the Java runtime environment to files encoded in
       ASCII, using Unicode escapes ("\uxxxx"  notation)  for  all  characters
       that  are not part of the ASCII character set. This process is required
       for properties files containing characters not in ISO-8859-1  character
       sets. The tool can also perform the reverse conversion.

       If  outputfile  is  omitted, standard output is used for output. If, in
       addition, inputfile is omitted, standard input is used for input.

OPTIONS
          -reverse
             Perform  the  reverse  operation:  Convert  a  file  encoded   in
             ISO-8859-1 with Unicode escapes to a file in any character encod-
             ing supported by the Java runtime environment.

          -encoding encoding_name
             Specifies the name of the character encoding to be  used  by  the
             conversion  procedure. If this option is not present, the default
             character      encoding      (as      determined      by      the
             java.nio.charset.Charset.defaultCharset   method)  is  used.  The
             encoding_name string must be the name  of  a  character  encoding
             that is supported by the Java runtime environment - see the Sup-
             ported Encodings @
             http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/intl/encod-
             ing.doc.html document.

          -Joption
             Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where option is one of
             the options described on the reference page for the java(1). For
             example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory to 48 megabytes.
