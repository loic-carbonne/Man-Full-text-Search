CAJA-CONNECT-SERVER(1)          General Manual          CAJA-CONNECT-SERVER(1)



NAME
       Caja-connect-server - Connect to Server dialog for Caja

SYNOPSIS
       caja-connect-server [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Caja Connect Server is the connection manager for Caja/MATE. It is pro-
       vided as a part of the Caja package for the MATE Desktop Environment.

       Simply running  "caja-connection-server"  will  open  a  simple  dialog
       allowing you to select the server type, and specify the server address,
       port, and login credentials for the server you want to connect to. This
       is  the  same  dialog accessible via the Caja "File" menu, and the MATE
       Desktop "Places" menu.

       You can use the Caja file manager to access remote servers such as SSH,
       FTP, and WebDav (HTTP/HTTPS) Servers.

       If  you desire to mount and access remote servers via console commands,
       you should use caja directly. See: caja(1)

              X display to use.

              Print standard command line options.
