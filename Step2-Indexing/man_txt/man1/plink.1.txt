NAME
       plink - PuTTY link, command line network connection tool

SYNOPSIS
       plink [options] [user@]host [command]

DESCRIPTION
       plink is a network connection tool supporting several protocols.

OPTIONS
       The command-line options supported by plink are:

       -V     Show version information and exit.

       -pgpfp Display  the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys and exit,
              to aid in verifying new files released by the PuTTY team.

       -v     Show verbose messages.

       -load session
              Load settings from saved session.

       -ssh   Force use of SSH protocol (default).

       -telnet
              Force use of Telnet protocol.

       -rlogin
              Force use of rlogin protocol.

       -raw   Force raw mode.

       -serial
              Force serial mode.

       -P port
              Connect to port port.

       -l user
              Set remote username to user.

       -m path
              Read remote command(s) from local file path.

       -batch Disable interactive prompts.

       -pw password
              Set remote password to password. CAUTION: this will likely  make
              the  password  visible  to other users of the local machine (via
              commands such as `w').

       -L [srcaddr:]srcport:desthost:destport
              Set  up  a  local  port  forwarding:  listen  on   srcport   (or
              srcaddr:srcport  if specified), and forward any connections over
              the SSH connection to the destination address desthost:destport.
              Only works in SSH.

       -R [srcaddr:]srcport:desthost:destport
              Set up a remote port forwarding: ask the SSH server to listen on
              srcport (or srcaddr:srcport if specified), and  to  forward  any
              connections  back  over the SSH connection where the client will
              pass them on to the destination address desthost:destport.  Only
              works in SSH.

       -D [srcaddr:]srcport
              Set  up  dynamic  port forwarding. The client listens on srcport
              (or  srcaddr:srcport  if  specified),  and  implements  a  SOCKS
              server.  So  you can point SOCKS-aware applications at this port
              and they will automatically use the SSH connection to tunnel all
              their connections. Only works in SSH.

       -X     Enable X11 forwarding.

       -x     Disable X11 forwarding (default).

       -A     Enable agent forwarding.

       -a     Disable agent forwarding (default).

       -t     Enable pty allocation (default if a command is NOT specified).

       -T     Disable pty allocation (default if a command is specified).

       -1     Force use of SSH protocol version 1.

       -2     Force use of SSH protocol version 2.

       -C     Enable SSH compression.

       -i path
              Private key file for authentication.

       -s     Remote command is SSH subsystem (SSH-2 only).

       -N     Don't start a remote command or shell at all (SSH-2 only).

       -sercfg configuration-string
              Specify  the  configuration  parameters  for the serial port, in
              -serial mode. configuration-string should be  a  comma-separated
              list of configuration parameters as follows:

              o      Any  single  digit  from  5  to 9 sets the number of data
                     bits.

              o      `1', `1.5' or `2' sets the number of stop bits.

              o      Any other numeric string is interpreted as a baud rate.

              o      A single lower-case letter specifies the parity: `n'  for
                     none, `o' for odd, `e' for even, `m' for mark and `s' for
                     space.

              o      A single upper-case letter specifies  the  flow  control:
                     `N'  for  none, `X' for XON/XOFF, `R' for RTS/CTS and `D'
                     for DSR/DTR.
