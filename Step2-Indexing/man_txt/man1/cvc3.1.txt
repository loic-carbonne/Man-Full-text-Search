NAME
       cvc3 - automatic SMT theorem prover

SYNOPSIS
       cvc3 [option]... [filename]


DESCRIPTION
       CVC3  is an automated validity checker for a many-sorted (typed) first-
       order logic with built-in theories, including some support for  quanti-
       fiers,  partial functions, and predicate subtypes. The current built-in
       theories are the theories of

       o   equality over free (aka uninterpreted) function and predicate  sym-
           bols,

       o   real  and integer linear arithmetic (with some support for non-lin-
           ear arithmetic),

       o   bit vectors,

       o   arrays,

       o   tuples,

       o   records,

       o   user-defined inductive datatypes.

       CVC3 operates on files in the CVC Presentation Input  Language  or  the
       SMTLIB  input  language. If no input file is given on the command line,
       CVC3 reads standard input.


OPTIONS
       Only a few of the most frequently used options  are  given  below.  For
       more  details,  see  CVC3's built-in help (cvc3 -help) or the CVC3 web-
       site.

       -h[elp]
              List all of the options for controlling  CVC3.  Boolean  options
              are  marked  (b).  They are enabled by prefixing with + and dis-
              abled by prefixing with -.  In the help output, the current set-
              ting is given.  For example, the output lists

              (b) -interactive      Interactive mode

              Indicating that interactive mode is disabled. to enable interac-
              tive mode, the option +interactive  is  therefore  used.   Other
              options  are marked (s) for string arguments, or (i) for integer
              arguments.

       -version
              Print the version of CVC3 and exit.

       -lang  (presentation|smtlib|internal) Select the input  language  used.
              The default is presentation.

       +int[eractive]
              Enable  interactive  mode. Commands are read from standard input
              and processed immediately.

       +stats Print run-time statistics.

       -timeout t
              Automatically terminate CVC3 after t seconds.
