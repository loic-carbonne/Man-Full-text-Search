DESCRIPTION
       The jconsole command launches a graphical console tool that enables you
       to monitor and manage Java applications and virtual machines on a local
       or remote machine.

       On Windows, jconsole does not associate with a console window. It will,
       however, display a dialog box with error information if the jconsole
       command fails for some reason.

OPTIONS
          -interval=n
             Set the update interval to n seconds (default is 4 seconds).

          -notile

          -pluginpath plugins
             Specify a list of directories or JAR files which are searched for
             JConsole plugins. The plugins path should contain a provider-con-

             fied class name of the class implementing the com.sun.tools.jcon-
