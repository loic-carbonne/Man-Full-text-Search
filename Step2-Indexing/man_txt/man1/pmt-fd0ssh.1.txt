pmt-fd0ssh(1)                      pam_mount                     pmt-fd0ssh(1)



Name
       pmt-fd0ssh - pipe for password-over-stdin support to ssh

Syntax
       pmt-fd0ssh mount_command

Description
       This  is a wrapper for ssh which reads the password from stdin and sets
       things up so that ssh will recall the  wrapper  to  get  the  password,
       which will be read from the parent process using a pipe.

       It  is  used  by  pam_mount(8)  to mount SSH-based filesystems, such as
       ccgfs and sshfs.
