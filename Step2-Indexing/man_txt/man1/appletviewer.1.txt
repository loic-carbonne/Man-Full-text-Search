appletviewer(1)             General Commands Manual            appletviewer(1)



Name
       appletviewer - The Java Applet Viewer.

       The  appletviewer  command  allows  you to run applets outside of a web
       browser.

SYNOPSIS
       appletviewer [ options ] urls ...

DESCRIPTION
       The appletviewer command connects to the documents or resources  desig-
       nated  by  urls and displays each applet referenced by the documents in
       its own window. Note: if the documents referred to by urls do not  ref-
       erence  any  applets  with  the  OBJECT,  EMBED,  or  APPLET  tag, then
       appletviewer  does  nothing.  For  details  on  the  HTML   tags   that
       appletviewer supports, see AppletViewer Tags @
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/appletview-
       ertags.html.

       Note: The appletviewer is intended for development purposes only. See
       About Sample / Test Applications and Code for more information.

       Note: The appletviewer requires encoded URLs according to the escaping
       mechanism defined in RFC2396. Only encoded URLs are supported. However,
       file names must be unencoded, as specified in RFC2396.

OPTIONS
          -debug
             Starts the applet viewer in the Java debugger, jdb(1), thus
             allowing you to debug the applets in the document.

          -encoding    encoding name
             Specify the input HTML file encoding name.

          -Jjavaoption
             Passes through the string javaoption as a single argument to the
             Java interpreter which runs the appletviewer. The argument should
             not contain spaces. Multiple argument words must all begin with
             the prefix -J, which is stripped. This is useful for adjusting
             the compiler's execution environment or memory usage.
