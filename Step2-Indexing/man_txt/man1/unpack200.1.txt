Name
       unpack200 - JAR Unpacking tool

SYNOPSIS
       unpack200 [ options ] input-file JAR-file

       Options may be in any order. The last option on the command line super-
       sedes all previously specified options.

          input-file
             Name of the input file, which can be a pack200  gzip  file  or  a
             pack200  file.  The  input  could  also  be  JAR file produced by
             pack200(1) with an effort of 0. In this case the contents of  the
             input file will be copied to the output JAR file with the Pack200
             marker.

          JAR-file
             Name of the output JAR file.


DESCRIPTION
       unpack200 is a native implementation that transforms a packed file pro-
       duced by pack200(1) into a JAR file. Typical usage:

       % unpack200 myarchive.pack.gz myarchive.jar

       In  this  example, the myarchive.jar is produced from myarchive.pack.gz
       using the default unpack200 settings.

OPTIONS
       -Hvalue --deflate-hint=value

       Sets the deflation to be true, false, or keep on all entries  within  a
       JAR  file.  The  default  mode is keep. If true or false, overrides the
       default behavior and sets the deflation mode on all entries within  the
       output JAR file.

       -r --remove-pack-file

       Removes the input packed file.

       -v --verbose

       Outputs  minimal  messages.  Multiple specification of this option will
       output more verbose messages.

       -q --quiet

       Specifies quiet operation with no messages.

       -lfilename --log-file=filename

       Specifies a log file to output messages.

       -? -h --help

       Prints help information about this command.

       -V --version

       Prints version information about this command.

       -Joption

       Passes option to the Java launcher called by unpack200.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

        0 if successful completion;

       >0 if an error occurred.

NOTES
       This command should not be confused with unpack(1). They are distinctly
       separate products.

       The Java SE API Specification provided with the JDK is the superseding
