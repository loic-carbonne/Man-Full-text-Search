NAME
       busctl - Introspect the bus

SYNOPSIS
       busctl [OPTIONS...] [COMMAND] [NAME...]

DESCRIPTION
       busctl may be used to introspect and monitor the D-Bus bus.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --address=ADDRESS
           Connect to the bus specified by ADDRESS instead of using suitable
           defaults for either the system or user bus (see --system and --user
           options).

       --show-machine
           When showing the list of endpoints, show a column containing the
           names of containers they belong to. See systemd-
           machined.service(8).

       --unique
           When showing the list of endpoints, show only "unique" names (of
           the form ":number.number").

       --acquired
           The opposite of --unique -- only "well-known" names will be shown.

       --activatable
           When showing the list of endpoints, show only endpoints which have
           actually not been activated yet, but may be started automatically
           if accessed.

       --match=MATCH
           When showing messages being exchanged, show only the subset
           matching MATCH.

       --no-legend
           Do not print the legend, i.e. the column headers and the footer.

       --user
           Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than the
           service manager of the system.

       --system
           Talk to the service manager of the system. This is the implied
           default.

       -H, --host=
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username
           and hostname separated by "@", to connect to. The hostname may
           optionally be suffixed by a container name, separated by ":", which
           connects directly to a specific container on the specified host.
           This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance.
           Container names may be enumerated with machinectl -H HOST.

       -M, --machine=
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to
           connect to.

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

       list
           Show endpoints attached to the bus. This is the default if no
           command is specified.

       monitor [NAME...]
           Dump messages being exchanged. If NAME is specified, show messages
           to or from this endpoint. Otherwise, show all messages on the bus.

       status NAME
           Show process information and credentials of a bus endpoint.

       help
           Show command syntax help.
