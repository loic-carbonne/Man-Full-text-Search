NAME
       mate-search-tool - the MATE Search Tool

SYNOPSIS
       mate-search-tool [options]

       or select Search for Files...  from a Main Menu or from the Places menu
       in a Menu Bar

DESCRIPTION
       MATE Search Tool is a utility for finding files on your system. To per-
       form  a  basic  search,  you can type a filename or a partial filename,
       with or without wildcards. To refine your search, you can  apply  addi-
       tional search options.

       MATE  Search  Tool  uses  the find, grep, and locate UNIX commands. The
       case sensitivity of the search depends on your  operating  system.  For
       example,  on  Linux, the find, grep, and locate commands support the -i
       option, so all searches are case-insensitive.

       For full documentation see the MATE Search Tool online help.
