fai-do-scripts(1)                                            fai-do-scripts(1)



NAME
       fai-do-scripts - call configuration scripts

SYNOPSIS
       fai-do-scripts [OPTION] DIRECTORY

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  is only called internally by FAI and not directly by the
       user.

       fai-do-scripts executes all scripts  in  DIRECTORY  which  are  also  a
       defined  class.  If  the  name of the class is a directory, all scripts
       that match `[0-9][0-9].*' (starting with two digits) in this  directory
       are  executed.   So it is possible to have several scripts of different
       types (shell, cfengine,...) be executed for one class.


OPTIONS
       -h     Show help, version and summary of options.

       -L DIR Write log files to DIR.

       -n     Show type of scripts that would be executed, but do not  execute
              them.


EXAMPLES
       In FAI, fai-do-scripts is used in the following way:

          # fai-do-scripts /fai/scripts
