WINDMC(1)                    GNU Development Tools                   WINDMC(1)



NAME
       windmc - generates Windows message resources.

SYNOPSIS
       windmc [options] input-file

DESCRIPTION
       windmc reads message definitions from an input file (.mc) and translate
       them into a set of output files.  The output files may be of four
       kinds:

       "h" A C header file containing the message definitions.

       "rc"
           A resource file compilable by the windres tool.

       "bin"
           One or more binary files containing the resource data for a
           specific message language.

       "dbg"
           A C include file that maps message id's to their symbolic name.

       The exact description of these different formats is available in
       documentation from Microsoft.

       When windmc converts from the "mc" format to the "bin" format, "rc",
       "h", and optional "dbg" it is acting like the Windows Message Compiler.

OPTIONS
       -a
       --ascii_in
           Specifies that the input file specified is ASCII. This is the
           default behaviour.

       -A
       --ascii_out
           Specifies that messages in the output "bin" files should be in
           ASCII format.

       -b
       --binprefix
           Specifies that "bin" filenames should have to be prefixed by the
           basename of the source file.

       -c
       --customflag
           Sets the customer bit in all message id's.

       -C codepage
       --codepage_in codepage
           Sets the default codepage to be used to convert input file to
           UTF16. The default is ocdepage 1252.

       -d
       --decimal_values
           Outputs the constants in the header file in decimal. Default is
           using hexadecimal output.

       -e ext
       --extension ext
           The extension for the header file. The default is .h extension.

       -F target
       --target target
           Specify the BFD format to use for a bin file as output.  This is a
           BFD target name; you can use the --help option to see a list of
           supported targets.  Normally windmc will use the default format,
           which is the first one listed by the --help option.

       -h path
       --headerdir path
           The target directory of the generated header file. The default is
           the current directory.

       -H
       --help
           Displays a list of command line options and then exits.

       -m characters
       --maxlength characters
           Instructs windmc to generate a warning if the length of any message
           exceeds the number specified.

       -n
       --nullterminate
           Terminate message text in "bin" files by zero. By default they are
           terminated by CR/LF.

       -o
       --hresult_use
           Not yet implemented. Instructs "windmc" to generate an OLE2 header
           file, using HRESULT definitions. Status codes are used if the flag
           is not specified.

       -O codepage
       --codepage_out codepage
           Sets the default codepage to be used to output text files. The
           default is ocdepage 1252.

       -r path
       --rcdir path
           The target directory for the generated "rc" script and the
           generated "bin" files that the resource compiler script includes.
           The default is the current directory.

       -u
       --unicode_in
           Specifies that the input file is UTF16.

       -U
       --unicode_out
           Specifies that messages in the output "bin" file should be in UTF16
           format. This is the default behaviour.

       -v
       --verbose
           Enable verbose mode.

       -V
       --version
           Prints the version number for windmc.

       -x path
       --xdgb path
           The path of the "dbg" C include file that maps message id's to the
           symbolic name. No such file is generated without specifying the
           switch.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted
           in place of the original @file option.  If file does not exist, or
           cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
           character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
           option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including
           a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be
           included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain additional
           @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
