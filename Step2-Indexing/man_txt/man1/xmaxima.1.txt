NAME
       xmaxima - graphical frontend to maxima computer algebra system

SYNOPSIS
       xmaxima

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  was  written  for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
       because the original program does not have a manual page.

       xmaxima is a rather self-explanatory frontend to  the  maxima  computer
       algebra system.  Menus provide access to online help in html format, as
       well as to "netmath", a web-based mathematical exploration tool  hosted
       on  the  Internet.   Plots  appear in integrated sub-windows.  A maxima
       primer appears on startup, allowing the user to execute demos of maxima
       functionality with the mouse.

OPTIONS
       xmaxima takes no options.

SEE ALSO
       maxima(1),
       Maxima  has an extensive set of info pages provided in the Debian pack-
       age.
