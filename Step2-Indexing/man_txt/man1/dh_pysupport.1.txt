NAME
       dh_pysupport - use the python-support framework to handle Python
       modules

SYNOPSIS
       dh_pysupport [debhelper options] [-V X.Y] [-X item [...]] [-n] [module
       dirs ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_pysupport is a debhelper program that will scan your package, detect
       public modules in /usr/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages, and move them to
       the shared Python modules location. It will generate appropriate
       postinst/prerm scripts to byte-compile modules installed there for all
       available python versions.

       It will also look for private Python modules and will byte-compile them
       with the current Python version. You may have to list the directories
       containing private Python modules.

       If a file named debian/pyversions exists, it is used to determine the
       python versions with which the package can work.

       Appropriate dependencies on python-support, python and pythonX.Y are
       put in ${python:Depends}.  The ${python:Versions} and
       ${python:Provides} optional substitution variables are made available
       as well.

OPTIONS
       module dirs
           If your package installs private python modules in non-standard
           directories, you can make dh_pysupport check those directories by
           passing their names on the command line. By default, it will check
           /usr/lib/$PACKAGE, /usr/share/$PACKAGE, /usr/lib/games/$PACKAGE and
           /usr/share/games/$PACKAGE

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts.

       -d  This option is deprecated.

       -V X.Y
           Force private modules to be bytecompiled with the specific X.Y
           python version, regardless of the default python version on the
           system.

       -X item, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain "item" anywhere in their filename from
           being taken into account to generate the python dependency. It also
           excludes them from byte-compilation. You may use this option
           multiple times to build up a list of things to exclude.
