NAME
       linux_logo - Color ANSI penguin logo w/ system information.

SYNOPSIS
       linux_logo  [-h  |  -v ] [-a ] [ -b | -c] [-d] [-D file] [-e file] [-f]
       [-g | -l] [-k] [-i] [-n] [-p] [-s] [-u] [-x] [-y] [-o Num] [-t  string]

DESCRIPTION
       linux_logo  is  a program that generates a color ANSI picture of a pen-
       guin which includes some system information  obtained  from  the  /proc
       filesystem.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -v     Show version of program.

       -ascii -a
              Display the logo as monochrome ascii.

       -banner -b
              Display the banner-style logo.

       -classic -c
              Display the original penguin logo.

       -d     Disable "prettying" of output

       -D filename
              Use logo from "filename"

       -e filename
              Use cpuinfo from "filename" for debugging purposes

       -f     Force the screen clear before drawing the logo.

       -F STRING
              Use custom output STRING for sysinfo.  See below for more info.

       -g     Display only the system infomation.

       -i     Ignore the ~/.linux_logo and /etc/linux_logo.conf config files

       -k     Keep sysinfo flushed-left (non-centered)

       -l     Display only the logo.

       -L ... Custom logo options.  See README

       -o Num Shift output Num spaces to the right

       -p     Preserve cursor location

       -s     Skip  the  BogoMips  test [ speeds up display on non-Linux plat-
              forms ].

       -t string
              Display an arbitrary string

       -u     Display the system uptime.

       -w val Set screen width to val

       -y     Display the load average.


PROCESSOR INFORMATION
   CPUINFO
       The  cpuinfo  supplied  in  /proc/cpuinfo  is  not  always  usable   by
       linux_logo.   In  the relevant sysinfo_x.c file there is a place to add
       custom output formatting to "beautify" the cpuinfo.  For  instance  "K6
       (166  - 266)" is parsed to "K6". Formats have been added for the K6 and
       certain Cyrix microprocessors.

       If the cpuinfo for your microprocessor generates ugly output, send  the
       output  from  your  /proc/cpuinfo and a sample of how it should look to
       the author.

       Unfortunately the 2.0.x kernels don't know about newer  chips.   So  to
       get  linux_logo  to  recognize your Pentium II and newer chips you must
       find some piece of information in /proc/cpuinfo that distinguishes them
       from a pentium pro, or upgrade to a 2.2.x or 2.3.x kernel.

   FORMAT
       The  format  string special sequences start with # (use ## to print #).
       All other characters, except for \n,  are printed as is.


       Seq   Description               Output
       ----------------------------------------------------------------
       ##                              #
       #B    Bogomips                  374.37
       #C    Compiled Date             #47 Fri Jan 8 10:37:09 EST 1999
       #E    User Text                 My Favorite Linux Distribution
             Displayed with -t
       #H    Hostname                  deranged
       #L    Load average              Load average 0.04, 0.01, 0.01
       #M    Megahertz                 188Mhz
             where supported
       #N    Number of CPU's           Two
       #O    OS Name                   Linux
       #P    Processor or Processors   Processor
       #R    Ram                       64M
             in Megabytes
       #S    Plural                    s
       #T    Type of CPU               K6
       #U    Uptime                    Uptime 10 hours 59 minutes
       #V    Version of OS             2.2.0-pre5
       #X    CPU Vendor                AMD
       \\n   carriage return

       Notes:

       o   The letter after the # must be capitalized.

       o   Options not available are silently ignored.

       o   Megahertz only available on some platforms and newer kernels.

       o   See defaults.h on how to have #N report in non-english numbers.

       o   Plural [#S] gives nothing if there is 1 cpu, gives 's' otherwise.

       o   The "-y" and "-u" [display uptime and load  average]  command  line
           options don't affect the output if a custom format is used.

       The default banner format is:

       "#O Version #V, Compiled #C\n \
       #N #M#X#T Processor#S, #R RAM, #B Bogomips Total\n \
       #H\n"

       The  default  banner format displays the following on the author's com-
       puter:

         Linux Version 2.2.0-pre5, Compiled #47 Fri Jan 8 10:37:09 EST 1999
            One 188MHz AMD K6 Processor, 64M RAM, 374.37 Bogomips Total
                                      deranged
       Another example would be:

       linux_logo -F "Redhat Linux 5.2\nKernel Version #V\n#U\n#L\n"

       which would display:

                                  Redhat Linux 5.2
                              Kernel Version 2.2.0-pre5
                              Uptime 11 hours 4 minutes
                            Load average 0.00, 0.00, 0.00


DEBIAN
       The Debian pre-packaged version of linux_logo includes the Debian  logo
       in addition to the 'Classic' and 'Banner' logos. The Debian logo is the
       default logo unless one of the other logos is specified on the  command
       line.

CONFIG FILES
       ~/.linux_logo  and /etc/linux_logo.conf can be filled with command line
       options and will be parsed before the actual command line
