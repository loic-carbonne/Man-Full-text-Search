OCAMLPROF(1)                General Commands Manual               OCAMLPROF(1)



NAME
       ocamlprof - The OCaml profiler


SYNOPSIS
       ocamlprof [ options ] filename ...


DESCRIPTION
       The  ocamlprof command prints execution counts gathered during the exe-
       cution of a OCaml program instrumented with ocamlcp(1).

       It produces a source listing of the program modules given as  arguments
       where execution counts have been inserted as comments. For instance,

       ocamlprof foo.ml

       prints the source code for the foo module, with comments indicating how
       many times the functions in this module have  been  called.  Naturally,
       this information is accurate only if the source file has not been modi-
       fied since the profiling execution took place.


OPTIONS
       -f dumpfile
              Specifies an alternate dump file of profiling information.

       -F string
              Specifies an additional  string  to  be  output  with  profiling
              information.   By  default,  ocamlprof(1) will annotate programs
              with comments of the form (* n *) where n is the  counter  value
              for  a  profiling point. With option -F s the annotation will be
              (* sn *)

       -impl filename
              Compile the file filename as an implementation file, even if its
              extension is not .ml.

       -intf filename
              Compile  the  file  filename  as  an interface file, even if its
              extension is not .mli.

       -version
              Print version string and exit.

       -vnum  Print short version number and exit.

       -help or --help
              Display a short usage summary and exit.
