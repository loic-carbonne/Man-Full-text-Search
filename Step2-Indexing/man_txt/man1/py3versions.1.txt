PY3VERSIONS()                                                    PY3VERSIONS()



NAME
       py3versions - print python3 version information

SYNOPSIS
       py3versions [-h] [-v] [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
       py3versions  prints information about installed, supported python3 run-
       times, the default runtime, and parses the information of  the  Python-
       Version fields in the package control file for Python3.

OPTIONS
       -d, --default
              Show the default python3 version.

       -s, --supported
              Show the supported python3 versions.

       -r, --requested [<version string>|<control file>]
              Reads  the  value  of  the X-Python3-Version field in the source
              section of a control file and shows all  matching  python3  ver-
              sions.  The  parameter is interpreted as a version string, if it
              is not the name of a file. If  the  X-Python3-Version  field  is
              missing,  it  will  fall back to list the supported Python3 ver-
              sions after checking debian/control. Versions less  than  3  are
              ignored.  The  keyword  all  is  ignored  because  it covers all
              Python2 versions.  The former keyword current is  not  supported
              at all in Python3.

       -i, --installed
              Show the installed supported python3 versions.

       -v, --version
              Limit the output to the version numbers of the python3 versions.

       -h, --help
              Print a help text.
