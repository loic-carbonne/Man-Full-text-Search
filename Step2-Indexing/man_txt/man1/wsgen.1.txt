Overview
       The wsgen tool generates JAX-WS portable artifacts used in  JAX-WS  web
       services. The tool reads a web service endpoint class and generates all
       the required artifacts for  web  service  deployment,  and  invocation.
       JAXWS 2.1.1 RI also provides a wsgen ant task, see Wsgen ant task @
       https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/nonav/2.1.1/docs/wsgenant.html for details.

Launching wsgen
          o Solaris/Linux

             * export JAXWS_HOME=/pathto/jaxws-ri

             * $JAXWS_HOME/bin/wsgen.sh -help

          o Windows

             * set JAXWS_HOME=c:\pathto\jaxws-ri

             * %JAXWS_HOME%\bin\wsgen.bat -help


Syntax
       wsgen [options] <SEI>

       The following table lists the wsgen options.

Example
       wsgen -d stock -cp myclasspath stock.StockService

       This will generate the wrapper classes needed for StockService anno-
       tated with @WebService annotation inside stockdirectory.
       wsgen -wsdl -d stock -cp myclasspath stock.StockService

       This will generate a SOAP 1.1 WSDL and schema for your Java class
       stock.StockService annotated with @WebService annotation.
       wsgen -wsdl:Xsoap1.2 -d stock -cp myclasspath stock.StockService

       Will generate a SOAP 1.2 WSDL.

       Note that you do not have to generate WSDL at the development time as
       JAXWS runtime will automatically generate a WSDL for you when you
       deploy your service.
